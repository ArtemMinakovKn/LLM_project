Facebook announced a 53% rise in second quarter revenue on the back of a 61% gain in its advertising revenue (the bulk of Facebook's revenue stream.) Within that advertising segment, mobile ad revenue rose 75% to $656 million. Analysts had been expecting mobile ad revenue to come in around $455 million for the quarter. Surprise -- it's the surprise of thisearnings season-- doesn't seem to do that beat justice. In just six months Facebook has seen daily mobile users rise from 293 million to 469 million.Facebook announced that startling result after the market close on Wednesday July 24th. By mid-day Thursday, Facebook trading volume was over 221 million shares. As this stock chart shows, that's more than seven times the normal pace for the month.FB Volumedata byYChartsSellers are having a fine time, as the stock price rose 25% on the strong second quarter-earnings. But buying at $33 and change is a bit of a valuation leap of faith.FBdata byYChartsA few weeks ago,YCharts explored the Market VectorsWide Moat ETF (MOAT), a portfolio that followings Morningstar's market-beating Wide Moat index.The index is rebalanced quarterly, to hold the 20 wide-moat stocks that are trading at the steepest price discount to Morningstar's estimate of their fair value. At the time of that late June rebalance, Facebook was trading at a 30% discount to Morningstar's $34 per share fair value estimate. That made Facebook the second-cheapest stock in the 20-stock portfolio. Only Western Union (WU) and its 32% discount was cheaper.In a note following Facebook's monster 2nd quarter release, Morningstar (Full Disclosure: Morningstar is an investor in YCharts) analyst Rick Summer reiterated that Morningstar is keeping its $34 fair value estimate. So by Morningstar's own criteria, if the Wide Moat index was rebalanced today, Facebook would be sold at a sweet profit given that the stock now sells at a discount of less than 3% of its fair value. Among Morningstar's universe of wide moat stocks that would be replacement candidates are  companies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Coca-Cola (KO), and Baxter International (BAX) which recently traded at discounts of at least 10% to Morningstar's estimate of fair value.That's not to say Facebook is primed for a fall. In fact, Morningstar puts a price north of $50 a share on when investors should consider selling. What has shifted in less than one trading day is that Facebook has gone from value stock to a growth stock with a whole lot of continued growth expectations embedded in its current price.The current expectation is for Facebook's per-share earnings to come in at 39 cents for the year. It earned 9 cents in the first quarter and 13 cents in the second quarter. Even if earnings didn't grow in the final two quarters and held at 13 cents per diluted share, that gets us to 48 cents. But just keep in mind that EPS has been anything but a straight line north:Loading...Loading...FB EPS Diluted Quarterlydata byYChartsConvinced the mobile push is a game changer? Okay, let's presume the second quarter eps growth rate of 44% over the first quarter can be replicated in the next two quarters. That gets us to about 68 cents a share. That works out to a 49PE ratiobased on Facebook's current price. That's still way short of where the market has sent theforward PE ratioin the last 24 hours:FB Forward PE Ratiodata byYChartsSure, Facebook could see accelerated earnings growth above the 2nd quarter rate, but its own success is going to make that harder. At the beginning of the year, daily mobile users accounted for 56% of total daily users, as of the end of the second quarter that was up to 67%. Still room for growth, but closing fast. All eyes -- and expectations -- are on Facebook's expected launch of video advertising to provide another revenue jolt. And maybe someday they will get around to monetizing the $1 billion Instagram investment. Plenty of opportunity. But after a 25% price gain, a dicier value proposition going forward.Carla Fried, a senior contributing editor at ycharts.com, has covered investing for more than 25 years.

Eight stocks were booted from the index, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC), replaced by another eight companies including Facebook (FB), eBay (EBAY) and money management firm Franklin Resources (BEN).More on the portfolio changes in a sec; understanding the underpinnings of Morningstar's strategy is in order.A moat is a competitive advantage. For a quick master class on the topic, check out the 2007Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) shareholder letter; chairman Warren Buffett spills some valuable ink explaining.Morningstar looks for five different moats: Intangible Assets, Switching Costs, Network Effect, Cost Advantage and Efficient Scale. (You canread more here:)The 1,200 or so companies that are tracked by Morningstar analysts are assigned one of three moat ratings: No Moat, Narrow Moat and Wide Moat. Wide Moat stocks must have at least one of the attributes.Morningstar isn't interested in short-term moats. It crunches the numbers in pursuit of companies it estimates will still be producing highreturn on invested capital(ROIC) 20 years out.Apple (AAPL) is producing strong ROIC right now. But given the vagaries of consumer taste, somewhat low switching costs (when it's time for an upgrade it's not a big deal to ditch your iPhone for the Samsung Galaxy) and the disruptive nature of technology advances, it's hard to extrapolate with any certainty where Apple will be 20 years from now. Morningstar currently rates Apple Narrow Moat. Contrast Apple's market pressures with that of a Qualcomm (QCOM) or Oracle (ORCL)—both wide moat stocks-where the switching costs for companies using their products is high in terms of both actual cost and any employee re-training.You can do more detailedinvestment analysison YCharts.Morningstar culls its list of 150 or so wide-moat stocks into the 20-stock portfolio for the index based on valuation. Morningstar has a proprietary analysis system that assigns a fair value price to stocks it covers. Stocks trading at the widest discount to their fair value are the most compelling.Eight stocks were kicked out of the index this quarter; all eight maintain their wide moat status, but at their current price aren't trading at much (if any) of a discount to their fair value estimate. The eight that got the boot in late June: Applied Materials (AMAT), Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), Compass Minerals International (CMP), General Dynamics (GD), John Wiley & Sons (JWA), St. Jude's Medical (STJ) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM).Loading...Loading...The eight wide-moat companies that are added to the index for the upcoming quarter had a price as of the June 21 rebalance that Morningstar deemed was at least 15% below its fair value. The eight additions: Amgen (AMGN), Franklin Resources, eBay, Facebook, Maxim Integrated Products (MXM), Oracle (ORCL), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Schlumberger (SLB). Facebook, which Collins says benefits from a strong networking effect (the more people who use, the more people who want to use) has the biggest discount to fair value: 30% as of last Friday. Morningstar has a $35 fair value on Facebook shares, a level it hasn't touched since its May 2012 IPO.FBdata byYChartsWestern Union (WU), an index holdover from last quarter, currently has the largest discount to Morningstar's fair value estimate -- at 32%. The most “expensive” stock in the wide moat index for the coming quarter is Berkshire Hathaway, which Morningstar says currently trades at a 12% discount to its fair value. By way of comparison, the average wide-moat stock currently trades at an average 5% discount, slightly better than the 4% discount for all Morningstar-rated stocks.In its quarterly rebalancing, Morningstar also provided a neat watchlist: stocks 21-30 in their valuation of wide-moat stocks. These are the companies that just missed the cut for the 20-stock portfolio for this quarter, but could bubble up in the near future if either their fair value is adjusted (Morningstar tends to evaluate one a quarter) and/or the price slumps from here. Morningstar's self-described Next 10 potential holdings with their current Fair Value estimate are (including a few just booted): Medtronic (MDT), $60, Baxter International (BAX), $80, ITC Holdings (ITC), $98, Coca-Cola (KO), $45, Applied Materials ($17), Compass Minerals International (CMP), $94, Amazon.com (AMZN), $300, Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), $119, St. Jude Medical (STJ), and John Wiley & Sons (JW.A) $45.Carla Fried, a senior contributing editor at ycharts.com, has covered investing for more than 25 years.

The portable device dubbed “ReVel” is geared for pediatric and adult patients requiring breathing support during transport.The ReVel is CareFusion's second palm top ventilator. The company, in December 2010, introduced the EnVe ventilator, the first in this category. Both these ventilators are engineered with the company's proprietary “ActivCore” gas delivery system. The palm top ventilator technology offers high-end critical care ventilation and freedom from wall-air systems.The ReVel ventilator, which complements the company's alternate care offerings (includes emergency and military respiratory care), is designed to help physicians improve patient care, optimize ventilator therapy and cut costs. It has the ability to manage most critical and non-invasively ventilated patients from the point of emergency through the hospital, allowing potentially life-saving ventilation during transit.Moreover, the new ventilator offers monitoring and clinical tools to help physicians better manage andcare for patients. Its Spontaneous Breathing Trial (“SBT”) technology provides data which enables clinicians to safely detach patients from ventilation at the right time. The ReVel ventilator is also equipped with an integrated pulse oximeter for monitoring a patient's pulse rate and oxygen saturation level during transport.The device weighs just 9.5 pounds compared with conventional systems which weigh more than 20 pounds. This light-weight device mountseasily in ground and air emergency vehicles including ambulances, helicopters and military aircraft.California-based CareFusion is dedicated to facilitate hospitals improvesafety and quality of care for patients.

This technology is intended to protect healthcare workers from injuries via needlestick and exposure to blood. In other words, it is geared to safeguard technicians from the risk of infection from pathogens in the blood.In addition to protection from needlestick injuries, one study found that theBD Insyte Autoguard BC with Blood Control Technologycuts down on the risk of exposure to blood by 95%, compared with a non-blood control IV catheter. This latest blood control know-how is a septum within the catheter hub intended to prevent blood from spilling out during insertion of the catheter.Lab technicians encounter leakage of blood in almost 40% of cases. This latest safety catheter from Becton is geared to cut down on the risk of exposure to mucocutaneous blood. Mucocutaneous exposure refers to body fluid exposure to the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, eyes or skin. Becton's latest product should also reduce contamination by blood of other surfaces such as floors and beds.More information on the new BD Insyte Autoguard BC with Blood Control Technology may be obtained from company web-sites and phone numbers.SPIVCs are common devices utilized to access blood vessels. According to several released studies, as many as 37.8% of healthcare technicians reported that they faced at least one instance of exposure to body fluid or blood over the past year. One study found that nurses face the highest risk.We remain cautious about Becton Dickinson due to the lack of major short-term catalysts. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is already largely penetrated. On the positive side, Becton Dickinson's preeminent global healthcare products franchise is partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the healthcare delivery field.Becton Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors, includingBaxter International(BAX) in certain niches, in each of its three business segments. We currently have a long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock, backed by a short-term Zacks #3 Rank (Hold).BAXTER INTL (BAX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."
269,6200,Becton to Fight Cervical Cancer - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/09/1922944/becton-to-fight-cervical-can,2011-09-16,BAX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Leading global medical technology companyBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) recently disclosed its commitment to “Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon”, in an effort to exploit private and public investments in worldwide healthcare. Their focus will be to fight breast and cervical cancer. Leadership will be provided by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (“PEPFAR”), George W. Bush Institute, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and Susan G. Komen for the Cure.Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon is an effort to harness private and public investments in healthcare to fight breast and cervical cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. The organization will increase the availability of cervical cancer monitoring and treatment among at-risk women in less developed nations. The effort will harness the platform of the PEPFAR model. Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon has received commitment for $80 million for 5 years.Cervical cancer is a major killer among young women in the less developed nations. It is the third most frequently occurring cancer among women and the most common in Africa. Cervical cancer is also widely prevalent in certain parts of Latin America. Over 85% of the worldwide burden from cervical cancer occurs in the developing world, where it constitutes 13% of all cancers striking women; yet, less than 5% of the afflicted have access to screening even once in their lives.Becton Dickinson's cervical cancer diagnostic methodologies use liquid-based cytology, a process of readying cervical cells for scrutiny in a lab. The centrifuging mechanism in liquid-based cytology leads to better samples which are easier for lab technicians to analyze.Becton Dickinson will support Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon to provide sustainable and dispersed access to modern cancer diagnostic know-how for patients residing in nations aided by PEPFAR. To achieve its purpose, Becton Dickinson will provide steeply discounted pricing on critical cervical cancer diagnostic tests in low income nations.The discount may be quantified at about $10 million for every 1 million women tested. In addition, Becton Dickinson will impart training to lab technicians on screening for cervical cancer. It will also cooperate with Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon staff to formulate country-based guidelines for proper screening modalities.For its part, a spokesperson for Becton Dickinson stated that the company shares a vision with U.S. Government, UNAIDS and The George W. Bush Institute to fight cervical cancer. A representative of the George W. Bush Institute said that one of its goals is to cut down mortality from cervical cancer by about 25% among women monitored and treated under this initiative.Based on the anticipated favorable foreign exchange impact, Becton Dickinson has hiked its revenue and earnings forecasts for fiscal 2011. The company now expects sales for the year to grow near the higher end of its previously communicated range of 5% to 6% year over year. On a currency neutral basis, sales are expected to increase by about 3% (versus 3.5% earlier) on account of lower sales in Western Europe.Moreover, the company has raised its earnings per share (on a reported basis) from continuing operations to a new range of $5.65 to $5.70 from its prior view of $5.55 to $5.65, reflecting about 15% to 16% year-over-year growth. Earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 are expected to be 14% to 15% higher than adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.94 in fiscal 2010.We remain cautious about Becton Dickinson due to the lack of major short-term catalysts. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is already largely penetrated. On the positive side, Becton Dickinson's pre-eminent global healthcare products franchise is partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the healthcare delivery field.Becton Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors, includingBaxter International(BAX) in certain niches, in each of its three business segments.

270,6201,Haemonetics Remains Neutral - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/09/1920963/haemonetics-remains-neutral-,2011-09-15,BAX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Recently, we reiterated our Neutral recommendation onHaemonetics Corporation(HAE) with a target price of $63.00.Haemonetics reported an adjusted EPS of 65 cents in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents and the year-ago quarter's adjusted EPS of 74 cents. The company was impacted by the OrthoPAT devices recall during the quarter.In addition, high costs were incurred in an effort to substitute plasma HS core product (to collect plasma for transfusion) in certain European countries. These challenges will continue to impact over the remainder of the year, as Haemonetics strives to improve its quality and product portfolio.The company reported revenues of $170.6 million in the quarter, up 5% compared with the year-ago period. However, revenues were lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $175 million. Revenues from the domestic market increased 8.9% to $86.4 million, while international revenues came down by 0.5% to $84.2 million during the quarter.Haemonetics remained focused on blood management solutions to provide better services to customers. The company's web-based blood management portal, IMPACT Online, has witnessed greater acceptance among customers.Some of the renowned institutions such as John Hopkins Hospital and Engelwood Hospital have decided to implement IMPACT Online. During the reported quarter, the company added 11 new IMPACT accounts, resulting in total of 208.Haemonetics is currently working on a next-generation surgical blood salvage device, an automated whole blood collection system. The company is progressing with the development of the system, details of which will be available at the end of the current quarter. The company has also allocated resources to its subsidiary, Arryx (acquired in July 2006), for continuing its research in nanotechnology applications in the blood typing and screening field.The company has witnessed strong potential in the $1.8 billion worldwide blood typing market, which does basic ABO/RH typing, antibody screening and antibody identification. Work on a device demonstrating stability, accuracy and speed of blood typing has been completed and several tests were conducted that met the benchmark of quality and speed without any unexpected issues.Full study results will be delivered in November 2011. We believe successful development of these initiatives should drive revenues of the company in the long-term.For the full year, the total impact of product recall and substitution of HS core bowl is estimated to be around $10 million or $0.25 per share. However, the impact from these headwinds could worsen if the company witnesses any further hiccup in its recovery plan. Moreover, Haemonetics operates in a very competitive environment with the presence of players such asBaxter(BAX),Abbott(ABT) among others.ABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBAXTER INTL (BAX): Free Stock Analysis ReportHAEMONETICS CP (HAE): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

The transaction is expected to be completed after antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions.Colorado-based Baxa, develops pharmacy technology for safe and effective preparation and delivery of oral and intravenous drugs. The entity generated sales of roughly $150 million in 2010. Baxa's broad product/solution range include the ExactaMix compounder, an automated compounding system, and the DoseEdge pharmacy workflow manager, an integrated system for managing oral and intravenous dose preparation.The acquisition bodes well for Baxter as the addition of Baxa's products will complement its nutrition products and drug delivery systems. With these new products, the company will be able to offer a complete solution to meet the nutritional needs of the majority of patients.Nutrition is regarded as a key element of therapy and both the entities are committed to advancing the delivery of intravenous nutrition leveraging their novel technologies. Baxter expects the deal to be neutral to its 2012 earnings and accretive afterwards.Baxter is a leading global medical products and services company that develops, manufactures and markets products to treat hemophilia (a bleeding disorder), kidney and infectious diseases. Itsmedical products business offers products (including multi-chamber containers and premixed drugs and drug-reconstitution systems) used in the delivery of drugs and fluids to patients. Baxter competes withBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) andJohnson & Johnson(JNJ), among others.Baxter's products are primarily life-sustaining, which partly insulates it against economic downturns. The company is able to generate recurring revenues, and consistent cash flow, due toits focus on chronic diseases.On the other hand, despite recent improvement in Plasma Proteins and Antibody Therapy sub-segments, we are concerned about stagnation in sales, a slightly somber outlook for some hospital spending and tightening of reimbursement.

Among the positive factors, Baxter retains a strong product pipeline with several products in late-stage clinical development.Highlights from the Second QuarterReported net income increased to $615 million (or $1.07 per share) versus $535 million (or 90 cents a share) a year ago.Total revenues were $3,536 million, up 11% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,378 million. U.S. revenues for the quarter jumped 5% to $1,418 million while ex-U.S. sales were higher 15% (up 7% in constant currency) to $2,118 million.The Plasma Proteins business, where Baxter had encountered structural problems in the past, performed well with revenues of $363 million, up 16% (up 11% in constant currency) year over year. Antibody Therapy also delivered good results with sales of $381 million, climbing 23% (up 21% in constant currency) year over year.We have discussed the quarterly results at length here:Baxter Beats Easily, Ups ViewAgreement – Estimate RevisionsThe overall trend in estimate revisions for fiscal 2011 is overwhelmingly positive since the release of the second quarter results. Out of a total of 17 analysts covering the stock, 15 have raised their estimates over the past month with no instance of downward revision. Likewise, 11 analysts (out of a total of 19) have raised their forecasts for 2012 over the past month with only 1 lowering his/her estimate. There was no movement at all in either direction, over the past week, for either 2011 or 2012. Improved execution by the company led to the positive outlook for the coming years.Loading...Loading...Magnitude – Consensus Estimate TrendUpward estimate revisions, accompanied by directional agreement for the most part, have led to a rise in annual forecasts for Baxter. Estimates for 2011 and 2012 have gone up by 4 cents each, over the past 30 days. Estimates for 2011 and 2012 have been flat, over the past 7 days.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2011 is $4.30, reflecting an estimated 8.03% year-over-year growth.Baxter Stays at NeutralBaxter issued its guidance for third-quarter fiscal 2011 and raised its earnings estimates for 2011. For the third quarter, the company expects growth in revenues in the range of 3% to 4% in constant currency and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.07 to $1.09.For fiscal 2011, Baxter still anticipates growth in revenues in the range of 3% to 4% in constant currency and raised expectations for adjusted earnings per share to a band of $4.27 and $4.32 (earlier $4.20 and $4.28). In addition, the company forecasts cash flow from operations of about $2.8 billion.The news regarding Baxter still remains mixed. On the positive side, Baxter's focus on life-sustaining products, which are not commoditized, partly insulates it from an economic downturn. The company is able to generate recurring revenues, and consistent cash flow, due to its focus on chronic diseases.On the flip side, despite recent improvement in Plasma Proteins and Antibody Therapy sub-segments, we are concerned about stagnation in sales, a slightly somber outlook for some hospital spending and tightening of reimbursement.Improved execution has lifted sentiment somewhat toward Baxter. Baxter is a good bet for value investors willing to wait as fundamentals improve further. Among others, it competes withBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) in certain niches.

International sales were driven by sustained healthy growth in emerging markets, partly ebbed by the slowdown in Western European markets due to the weak economy.Segment ReviewAt BD Medical, Becton's largest division, global revenues climbed 10.5% (or 4.9% in constant currency) year over year to $1,045 million, driven by healthy revenues from Diabetes Care, Pharmaceutical Systems products and safety items.Within BD Medical, revenues from Medical Surgical Systems increased 7.2% year over year to $529 million.

The company now expects sales for the year to grow at the higher end of its previously communicated range of 5% to 6% year over year.On a currency neutral basis, sales are expected to increase at about 3% (versus 3.5% earlier) on account of lower sales in Western Europe.Moreover, the company has raised its earnings per share (on a reported basis) from continuing operations target to a new range of $5.65 to $5.70 from its prior view of $5.55 to $5.65, reflecting about 15% to 16% year-over-year growth.Earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 are expected to be 14% to 15% higher than adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.94 in fiscal 2010.Becton recently announced a definitive deal to buy Sweden-based Carmel Pharma, the maker of PhaSeal System, which is the leading closed system drug transfer device for handling hazardous medications.

The company has deployed more than 3,500 automation systems in retail and hospital pharmacies and added 500 new customers last year.In addition to its stronghold in Germany, Rowa has operations in Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. The company's installations climbed 9% in 2010 and it expanded product sales into Australia, Canada and other new markets during the year.Rowa's automated systems, which are used to store and retrieve packaged pharmaceutical inventories, are geared to cut costs and improve workflow.

This was the 12thstraight year in which the company has reported on its economic, social and environmental outcomes. This report highlights the company's progress toward its sustainability goals and its determination to counter challenges to global sustainability through a number of measures.The initiatives mentioned in the 2010 report include efforts to cut down on emission of green house gas, reduce water usage and outlay almost $80 million from The Baxter International Foundation to address urgent worldwide causes.Baxter's sustainability goals reflect issues of critical concern to the company and areas where it is well positioned to make a favorable impact. Each priority area is linked with long-term performance goals to aid measurement of progress. The company's sustainability priorities include improving access to healthcare, an inclusive workforce and a list of environmental initiatives, such as waste generation and cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions.Baxter recently obtained certification from the Carbon Trust Footprinting Certification Company for the Xenium+ synthetic dialyzer. This recognition is based on a check of carbon footprint analyses and a statement by Baxter to continue to reduce the carbon footprint of Xenium+ over the next couple of years. Xenium+ is the second medical product to receive such certification.Dialyzers are filters, which are used in hemodialysis to purify the blood of patients with kidney failure. The Xenium+ dialyzer is about 22% less heavy than prior models. It offers the potential for lower fuel consumption in shipping. Xenium+ dialyzers need about one-third less cardboard in packing.The verification studied the carbon ejection released during the production, distribution, usage and disposal of Xenium+ dialyzers vis-à-vis previous models. The analysis was done keeping in mind the British Standards Institution PAS 2050 Standard. Xenium+ dialyzers are currently available for sale in France, Sweden and Italy. Baxter has planned further launches for 2011 and 2012.Novation, a prominent healthcare supply contracting firm in the U.S., named Baxter as the 2011 Environmental Excellence Supplier of the Year. Novation chose Baxter for the honor based on its waste and energy conservation, production principles and corporate sustainability measures. Novation, since 1998, is a prominent healthcare supply contracting company.Baxter supports employees who volunteer time to their communities. During 2010, over 7,850 Baxter staff volunteered over 163,000 hours, an increase from levels attained in 2009.Improved execution has lifted sentiment toward Baxter.

282,6214,Baxter's Sustainability Report - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/07/1695129/baxters-sustainability-repor,2011-07-05,BAX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Baxter International(BAX) recently presented its 2010 Sustainability Report. This was the 12thstraight year in which the company has reported on its economic, social and environmental outcomes. This report highlights the company's progress toward its sustainability goals and its determination to counter challenges to global sustainability through a number of measures.The initiatives mentioned in the 2010 report include efforts to cut down on emission of green house gas, reduce water usage and outlay almost $80 million from The Baxter International Foundation to address urgent worldwide causes.Baxter's sustainability goals reflect issues of critical concern to the company and areas where it is well positioned to make a favorable impact. Each priority area is linked with long-term performance goals to aid measurement of progress. The company's sustainability priorities include improving access to healthcare, an inclusive workforce and a list of environmental initiatives, such as waste generation and cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions.Baxter recently obtained certification from the Carbon Trust Footprinting Certification Company for the Xenium+ synthetic dialyzer. This recognition is based on a check of carbon footprint analyses and a statement by Baxter to continue to reduce the carbon footprint of Xenium+ over the next couple of years. Xenium+ is the second medical product to receive such certification.Dialyzers are filters, which are used in hemodialysis to purify the blood of patients with kidney failure. The Xenium+ dialyzer is about 22% less heavy than prior models. It offers the potential for lower fuel consumption in shipping. Xenium+ dialyzers need about one-third less cardboard in packing.The verification studied the carbon ejection released during the production, distribution, usage and disposal of Xenium+ dialyzers vis-à-vis previous models. The analysis was done keeping in mind the British Standards Institution PAS 2050 Standard. Xenium+ dialyzers are currently available for sale in France, Sweden and Italy. Baxter has planned further launches for 2011 and 2012.Novation, a prominent healthcare supply contracting firm in the U.S., named Baxter as the 2011 Environmental Excellence Supplier of the Year. Novation chose Baxter for the honor based on its waste and energy conservation, production principles and corporate sustainability measures. Novation, since 1998, is a prominent healthcare supply contracting company.Baxter supports employees who volunteer time to their communities. During 2010, over 7,850 Baxter staff volunteered over 163,000 hours, an increase from levels attained in 2009.Improved execution has lifted sentiment toward Baxter. The company remains a good bet for value investors willing to wait as fundamentals improve. Among others, it competes withBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) in certain niches.

283,6215,Favorable Opinion for Baxter Drug - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/06/1204492/favorable-opinion-for-baxter,2011-06-27,BAX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Baxter International(BAX) recently revealed that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) belonging to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) has given a favorable opinion for extending the therapeutic indications of Kiovig to encompass a new indication for multifocal motor neuropathy (“MMN”), a debilitating disorder needing life-time therapy.Following acceptance by the European Commission, Baxter will be granted marketing authorization for the Kiovig MMN indication across all European Union (“EU”) nations.MMN is an uncommon autoimmune disorder marked by gradual weakening of the limbs. The victim faces difficulty performing simple tasks. If left untreated, MMN may degenerate into muscle atrophy or involuntary twitching.The favorable opinion for Kiovig MMN is underpinned by a couple of open-label, investigator-initiated prospective clinical efficacy studies on victims of MMN, both of which demonstrated upkeep of muscular strength and better functionality. Negative events were transient in nature and in line with those seen with other Kiovig indications.Earlier, Baxter launched a phase 3 trial, in 2008, in Canada and the U.S., for Gammagard Liquid (known as Kiovig overseas) for the treatment of MMN. Following its conclusion later this year, Baxter plans to obtain Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval. The company has received Orphan Drug Designation for this indication in the U.S.Kiovig originally received approval, in Europe, in 2006 and the drug has been obtainable in the U.S. since 2005. It is sold as Gammagard Liquid - Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human). Kiovig is a human normal immunoglobulin (“IVIG”), 10% solution used for multiple indications such as treatment of Primary Immunodeficiency Syndromes and recurrent bacterial infections in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Baxter reported first quarter adjusted (excluding one-time items) earnings per share of 98 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents, and surpassing the year-ago results of 93 cents. Total revenues were $3,284 million, up 12% year over year, also beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Among the positive factors, Baxter retains a strong product pipeline with several products in late-stage clinical development.Improved execution has improved sentiment toward Baxter. The company remains a good bet for value investors willing to wait as fundamentals improve. Among others, it competes withBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) in certain niches.

For fiscal 2011, the adjusted EPS came in at $3.27, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.25 and the previous year's $2.85.The company reported revenues of $170 million in the quarter, up 1% compared with the year-ago period. However, revenues were lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $181 million. After considering an extra week in fiscal 2010, revenues were up 8%. For fiscal 2011, revenues increased 5% to $677 million (up 7% excluding the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2010) but lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $686 million.Haemonetics remained focused on blood management solutions to provide better services to customers. The company's web-based blood management portal, IMPACT Online, has witnessed greater acceptance among customers. During the reported quarter, the company added 32 IMPACT accounts, resulting in total of 197 accounts comfortably exceeding the goal of 175 for fiscal 2011. In the North American patient business, the company implemented IMPACT at 115 hospitals and disposable revenue from these accounts grew 25% in fiscal 2011 compared to an 8% decline in the rest of North American patient business.  In fiscal 2012, the company will focus on larger hospitals and expects about 90% of incremental growth in North American patient sales in fiscal 2012 to come from IMAPCT accounts.Emerging markets are a key focus area of future growth for Haemonetics and generated more than $100 million in sales in fiscal 2011. The growth is expected to continue and will be driven by platelet disposable business and hospital product lines. Within a span of 5 years, business from this region has almost doubled. With further penetration, revenue contribution from emerging markets will constitute a major portion.Haemonetics records a majority of its revenues from plasma business, which has been witnessing several challenges over the past few quarters. However, the situation is gradually improving based on which the company expects a 3-5% growth in plasma business in fiscal 2012. The company also faces stiff competition from players such asBaxter(BAX),Abbott(ABT), among others.ABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBAXTER INTL (BAX): Free Stock Analysis ReportHAEMONETICS CP (HAE): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

Firstly, it wanted to provide researchers with one system which would tackle both mundane applications and complicated multi-color experiments. Secondly, the company wanted to simplify workflow and design an easy-to-use system with internal intelligence. Finally, Becton desired to preserve clients' investments by providing an upgrade mechanism for 10 parameters (versus 6 earlier) besides numerous optional features.Researchers can utilize the BD FACSuite Software System designed for the BD FACSVerse Flow Cytometer to automate normal tasks, such as instrument startup, setup and data analysis, as well as accomplish others with as few clicks as possible.The software's modular design allows users to multi-task, thereby permitting data analysis while, at the same time, the system is gathering data. BD FACSuite Software allows experiments and assays to be transferred to BD FACSVerse Systems based in other locations, thereby reducing frequently seen systemic and user-related divergences.The BD FACSVerse Flow Cytometer comes with its own intelligence that is designed to increase efficiency, cut down mistakes, automate processes and reduce interaction with users. For example, it has a vacuum-based fluidic component, which permits flexibility when introducing samples.The BD FACSVerse Flow Cytometer can now be obtained in different color configurations, such as 4-color, 6-color and 8-color setups, with forward-scatter and side-scatter support for as many as 10 parameters. The 4 and 6-color setups are expandable with upgrades. The system comes in a compact size which allows it to easily fit into standard lab bench tops.We remain cautious about Becton Dickinson due to a lack of major short-term catalysts. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is already largely penetrated.On the positive side, Becton Dickinson's preeminent global healthcare products franchise is partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the healthcare delivery field.Becton Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors, includingBaxter International(BAX) in certain niches, in each of its three business segments.

Net income for the quarter increased 4.8% year over year to about $312 million on the back of higher revenues across the board.The Results in BriefBecton Dickinson recorded revenues of $1,922 million in the reported quarter, up 6.8% (or 4.6% in constant currency) year over year, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,856 million.Domestic sales for the quarter were $829 million, up 4.7% year over year. Ex-U.S. revenues were $1,093 million, up 8.5%.

A similar trend was seen for fiscal 2012 with 16 analysts (out of 18) raised their forecast over the last 30 days (including 1 over the past 7 days) with no downward revision.We believe that the positive revisions are an outcome of the forecast-shattering second quarter results coupled with the company's upward guidance revision for fiscal 2011.Loading...Loading...Magnitude – Consensus Estimate TrendUniform upward directional movement has led to an increase in annual forecast for Becton Dickinson.

Among the positive factors, Baxter retains a strong product pipeline with several products in late-stage clinical development.Highlights from the First QuarterReported net income increased to $570 million (or 98 cents per share) versus a loss of $63 million (or 11 cents a share) a year ago. The first quarter results of 2010 included after-tax items aggregating $627 million (or $1.04 per share) arising from the Colleague infusion pump and a change in certain tax treatment.Total revenues were $3,284 million, up 12% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,178 million. Revenues in the prior year included an adjustment of $213 million for the Colleague infusion pump. Excluding this adjustment, worldwide sales grew 5% year over year. Domestic revenues for the quarter jumped 10% to $1,422 million while overseas sales were higher only 1% to $1,862 million.The Plasma Proteins business, where Baxter had encountered structural problems in the past, performed well with revenues of $308 million, up 5% (up 8% in constant currency) year over year. Antibody Therapy also delivered good results with sales of $374 million, climbing 16% (up 18% in constant currency) year over year.We have discussed the quarterly results at length here:Baxter Beats Fair and SquareAgreement – Estimate RevisionsThe overall trend in estimate revisions for fiscal 2011 is overwhelmingly positive since the release of the first quarter results. Out of a total of 18 analysts covering the stock, 13 have raised their estimates over the past month with no instance of downward revision. Likewise, 11 analysts (out of a total of 18) have raised their forecasts for 2012 over the past month with only 2 lowering their estimates.A positive trend is also noticed, over the past week, with 5 positive revisions and no downward movement in estimate revisions for fiscal 2011.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2011 is $4.25, reflecting an estimated 6.76% year-over-year growth.Estimates for 2011 and 2012 have gone up by a penny and 2 pennies, respectively, over the past 7 days.Baxter Stays at NeutralBaxter issued its guidance for second-quarter fiscal 2011 and raised its estimates for 2011. For the second quarter, the company expects growth in revenues in the range of 4% to 5% in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.01 to $1.03.Baxter anticipates growth in revenues in the range of 3% to 4% (earlier 2% to 3%), in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share of about $4.20 to $4.28 (earlier $4.15 to $4.25) for fiscal 2011.The news regarding Baxter remains somewhat mixed. On the positive side, Baxter's focus on life-sustaining products, which are not commoditized, partly insulates it from an economic downturn. The company is able to generate recurring revenues, and consistent cash flow, due to its focus on chronic diseases.On the flip side, despite recent improvement in Plasma Proteins and Antibody Therapy sub-segments, we are concerned about stagnation in sales, a still somber outlook for some hospital spending and tightening of reimbursement.Improved execution has improved sentiment toward Baxter.

Shares of New Jersey-based Becton Dickinson gained $1.26 to reach $86.15 in after-hours trading, following  better-than-expected results and its upward revision of guidance.RevenuesBecton Dickinson posted revenues of $1,922 million, up 6.8% (or 4.6% in constant currency) year over year, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,856 million.Geographically, domestic sales rose 4.7% year over year to $829 million while ex-U.S. sales jumped 8.5% to $1,093 million. International sales were driven by sustained healthy growth in emerging markets, partly ebbed by the slowdown in Western European markets due to a soft economy.Segment ReviewIn BD Medical, Becton's largest division, global revenues climbed 6.5% (or 4.9% in constant currency) year over year to $981 million, led by healthy revenues from Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems products. The results also reflect an unfavorable year over year comparison of roughly 1.6% due to sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic in fiscal 2010.Within BD Medical, revenues from Medical Surgical Systems rose 4.8% year over year to $504.6 million. Diabetes Care sales cruised 10.5% to $207.8 million while Pharmaceutical Systems revenues soared 6.6% to $269 million.In BD Diagnostics, global sales spiked 8.9% (or 6.5% in constant currency) year over year to $605.3 million, boosted by healthy revenues from Preanalytical Systems' safety-engineered products and solid Diagnostic Systems sales. Preanalytical Systems revenues surged 6.5% to $306.2 million while Diagnostic Systems sales climbed 11.6% to $299.1 million.Global sales from the BD Biosciences unit rose 4.1% (or 0.4% in constant currency) year over year to $335.3 million. While growthwas driven by higher cell analysis instrument and reagent sales, the results were negatively impacted by unfavorable comparisonand the impact of  the earthquake in Japan. Cell Analysis revenues climbed 5.4% to $255.5 million while Discovery Labware sales were essentially flat year over year at $79.8 million.Margins and ExpensesGross margin edged up to 52.1% in the reported quarter from roughly 52% a year-ago while operating margin fell narrowly to 22.9% from 23% in the prior-year quarter. Consolidated operating costs and expenses climbed 6.9% year over year to $1,481.7 million as the company spent more on both R&D (up 18.9%) and selling and administrative (up 5%) expenses.Loading...Loading...Accuri AcquisitionBecton announced, in February 2011, a definitive agreement to acquire Accuri Cytometers, a Michigan-based company, which makes personal flow cytometers for use by researchers. The acquisition, which is synergistic with Becton's strategy for its Cell Analysis sub-segment, was consummated in March 2011.JapanImpactBecton like many other top-tier medical technology companies was impacted by the massive temblor (and subsequent Tsunami) in Japan and its aftermath. Its manufacturing facility in Fukushima sustained some damage following the debacle, however, some manufacturing lines were restarted recently.The company stated that order volumes for its products in Japan have returned to normal levels and expects manufacturing of its Hypak prefillable syringes to resume in third-quarter fiscal 2011. The unfavorable impact of the Japan quake onits second quarter sales was less than $10 million. Becton expects an aggregate negative impact of $10-$20 million on its revenues for fiscal 2011, which has been factored into its full-year guidance.Outlook RaisedBased on the anticipated favorable foreign exchange impact, Becton Dickinson has hiked its revenue and earnings forecasts for fiscal 2011. The company now expects sales for the year to grow roughly 5%-6% year over year versus its earlier projected growth of 4%.Moreover, the company has raised its earnings per share (on a reported basis) from continuing operations target to a new range of $5.55 to $5.65 from its prior view of $5.45 to $5.55, reflecting a roughly 13%-15% year over year growth.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is $1.30, representing an estimated year-over-year increase of 4.74%.During an earlier announcement, the company had guided both reported and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 to grow about 10% to 12% to a range of $5.45 to $5.55. At the same time, Becton, Dickinson added that it expects fiscal 2011 revenues to increase about 4% year over year.First-Quarter RecapBecton, Dickinson reported first-quarter fiscal 2011 earnings of $1.35 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29. Total revenues decreased 1.4% year over year (1.5% in constant currency) to $1.84 billion and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 billion.Domestic sales for the quarter amounted to $829 million, down 2.9% year over year, including a negative impact of 6% from the flu pandemic in the preceding year. Overseas revenues were $1.01 billion, down 0.2% (or 0.3% in constant currency), including a negative impact of 3% from the flu pandemic. Becton, Dickinson experienced higher growth in emerging markets, offset by a slowdown in European markets.Estimate Revision TrendLoading...Loading...AgreementThe overall trend in estimate revisions for the upcoming quarter is relatively static. Of the 16 analysts covering the stock, there were no upward or downward revisions during the past 7 days. Only one analyst has raised his/her estimate in the past month while none lowered their forecast.With regard to fiscal 2011, only 1 analyst (out of 17) lifted his/her estimate over the last week with no reverse movements. Over the past month, three analysts raised their estimates while none moved in the opposite direction. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2011 is $5.51, reflecting an estimated 12.51% year-over-year growth.MagnitudeGiven the relative lack of estimate revisions, the magnitude of revisions for the forthcoming quarter and fiscal year has hit a plateau, for both the past 7 and 30 days.Becton, Dickinson has reported positive earnings surprises in three of the previous four quarters. The company produced an average positive earnings surprise of 1.97% over the prior four quarters, meaning that it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by that measure.Our Take on Becton, DickinsonBecton, Dickinson, a leading global medical technology company, produces and markets medical devices, instrument systems and reagents. The company is dedicated to enhancing drug delivery, improving the pace of diagnosing infectious diseases and cancer and advancing R&D for new drugs.We remain cautious about Becton, Dickinsondue to the lack of major short-term catalysts. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is already predominantly penetrated. Further, Becton, Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors in each of its three business segments.We are, however, hopeful that growth may recover in the future with the European Union adoption of safety requirements, recovery in research markets and continued growth in flow cytometry in the clinical setting. Becton, Dickinson'spreeminent global health care products franchise is partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the health care delivery field.The company competes, in niches, with different companies such asBaxter International(BAX) among others.

Subject to regulatory approvals, the deal is expected to conclude in the second quarter of 2011. The transaction is not forecast to materially impact Baxter's fiscal 2011 results.Prism Pharmaceuticals developed and then obtained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) certification for numerous presentations of NEXTERONE (amiodarone HCl), which is an antiarrhythmic substance. The NEXTERONE product line does not contain benzyl alcohol and polysorbate 80. It contains the sole ready-to-be used premixed intravenous (IV) bag formulations, vials as well as pre-filled syringe.The NEXTERONE IV formulations, in a premixed condition, were recently authorized by the FDA in a couple of readily usable dosages: 150 mg in a 100 ml package for quick 10-minute loading infusion and 360 mg in a 200 ml package for future loading and upkeep infusion.These formulations do not need mixing, thereby obviating possible medication mistakes related to compounding. Furthermore, NEXTERONE can be kept at normal temperature for 2 years. The product fits in automated dispensing furniture, placing it within patient care arenas ready for usage during critical situations.Before its decision to acquire Prism Pharmaceuticals, Baxter was its contract manufacturer, on the basis of selection by Prism, to produce the premixed IV bags utilizing Baxter's own GALAXY container know how as well as pre-filled syringes.Amiodarone can be categorized as an antiarrhythmic medicine used for ventricular tachyarrhythmias or rapid types of irregular heartbeat. NEXTERONE Premixed Injection is used for starting treatment and prophylaxis of common ventricular fibrillation and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia. NEXTERONE has several significant contraindications as provided by the company.The news regarding Baxter remains mixed. On the positive side, Baxter's focus on life-sustaining products, which are not commoditized, partly insulates it from an economic downturn. The company is able to generate recurring revenues, and consistent cash flow, due to its focus on chronic diseases.On the flip side, despite recent improvement in Plasma Proteins and Antibody Therapy sub-segments, we are concerned about stagnation in sales, a slightly somber outlook for some hospital spending and tightening of reimbursement.The lingering neutrality surrounding the stock can be lifted by consistent execution.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 93 cents, representing an estimated 0.20% annualized decline.Fourth Quarter RecapBaxter reported fourth quarter 2010 adjusted (excluding one-time items) earnings per share of $1.11, beating the corresponding Zacks Consensus Estimates of $1.10 and surpassing the year-ago result of $1.03.Reported net income dropped 26% year over year to $423 million (or 72 cents per share), mainly resulting from special after-tax charges of $227 million for asset impairment and costs related to Baxter's initiatives in the area of business optimization, higher reserves for litigation and in-process R&D expenses. Among the positive factors, Baxter retained a strong product pipeline with several products in late-stage clinical development.Revenues for the quarter were $3,498 million, up 1% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,460 million. Domestic revenues edged up 1% to $1,440 million while overseas sales were flat year over year (up 3% in constant currency) at $2,058 million.The Plasma Proteins business, where Baxter had encountered structural problems in the past, performed well with revenues of $416 million, up 9% (up 13% in constant currency) year over year. Antibody Therapy also delivered good results with sales of $386 million, climbing 10% (up 13% in constant currency) year over yearEstimate Revision TrendLoading...Loading...AgreementThe overall trend in estimate revisions for Baxter has seen minor activity in the recent past. Of the 16 analysts covering the stock, 1 raised his/her estimate, for the first quarter, over the last 7 days while there was no movement in the opposite direction. Moreover, one analyst increased his/her estimate, for the quarter, during the past month while there were no instances of downward movement.Estimates for 2011 have been inclined towards the positive side, with 2 out of 19 analysts raising his/her forecast over the prior week and 4 hiking their forecasts during the past month. There were no downward revisions during these timeframes. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2011 is $4.20, reflecting an estimated 5.62% year-over-year increase.MagnitudeGiven the relative shortage of estimate revisions, the magnitude of revisions for the forthcoming quarter has hit a plateau over the last week and month.Baxter has produced positive surprises in the previous three quarters and we expect a similar trend to continue. The company produced an average positive earnings surprise of 2.04% over the prior four quarters, meaning that it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by that measure.Our TakeThe news regarding Baxter remains mixed. On the positive side, Baxter's focus on life-sustaining products, which are not commoditized, partly insulates it from an economic downturn.

The company is extending its hand to the World Federation of Hemophilia (“WFH”) to start Advocacy in Action, a creative, multi-year project to assist nations play an advocacy role for victims of bleeding disorders.Baxter is funding this initiative with a grant. Furthermore, Advocacy in Action's role is intertwined with the WFH theme for World Hemophilia Day, which is “Be Inspired, Get Involved in Treatment for All”. Since its inception, in honor of Frank Schnabel in 1989, World Hemophilia Day (observed on April 17) has played a key role in heightening awareness of hemophilia and various bleeding problems.The overall longevity of hemophilia victims, in certain areas of the developed world, has crossed 60 years. Despite progress, wide disparities remain as 3 out of 4 victims do not receive proper medical care.According to WFH, its purpose is to make sure that all victims are diagnosed and receive treatment for their condition. For its part, Advocacy in Action is geared to accomplish this mission, which will lead to favorable results across the globe.Advocacy in Action is empowered to bolster WFH's national member organizations' (“NMOs”) capability to lobby their governments on behalf of those suffering from bleeding disorders. The effort includes specially crafted advocacy support, such as workshops, coaching programs and staffing to help implement public policy.Besides the new advocacy initiative, Baxter continues to support WFH's Global Alliance for Progress (“GAP”) program as its founder cum leading sponsor. Since its inception in 2003, over 22,000 victims have been diagnosed with bleeding problems in 16 nations and over 13,000 health care experts and regulators trained on the subject. Baxter has also reached out to hemophilia patients living in underserved nations.Baxter remains at the forefront of R&D efforts to treat hemophilia A and B and von Willebrand disease (a bleeding disorder afflicting both genders). Many preclinical, clinical and post-marketing trials are under progress to evaluate approaches for managing hemophilia.Overall, the news regarding Baxter remains mixed, at the Street.

Such know-how will assist hospitals cut down expenses, enhance regulatory control and further environmental responsibility.CareFusion has grown its Pyxis medication management portfolio with the Pyxis EcoStation (a software and hardware system that enables hospitals recognize, classify and separate pharmaceutical waste, while ensuring records to permit regulatory controls), by acquiring the California-based Vestara, which solely concentrated on devising solutions for the management of pharma-related waste.The Pyxis EcoStation system utilizes barcode know-how to recognize drugs and a data base of over 180,000 National Drug Code items to classify and segregate pharma-related waste just prior to disposal. The Pyxis EcoStation avoids human error, as well as the possibility of cross contamination, by automating the detection and classification of various residual drugs.The problem associated with pharmaceutical waste is expected to worsen with American hospitals buying over 4 billion bottles and vials containing hazardous substances. In addition, they produce over 84,000 tons of hazardous waste on an annual basis. According to a geological survey, pharma-related waste was detected in four-fifths of the water streams included in a sample.The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has bolstered enforcement throughout the nation. It can penalize hospitals up to $37,500 per violation, on a daily basis, for not conforming to established standards for disposal of pharmaceutical waste. For example, one large oncology hospital was recently penalized $372,254 for unacceptable treatment and storage of dangerous pharmaceutical waste.CareFusion is dedicated to facilitate hospitals measurably improve safety and quality of care for patients. The company is a leader in dispensing technology. It offers products in the areas of surgical instruments, respiratory care, IV infusion, medication and supply dispensing as well as infection prevention. CareFusion's products include Alaris IV pumps as well as the Pyxis automated dispensing and patient identification system.

Additionally, it works as an effective microbial barrier against bacteria transfer and contamination. The full set of MicroCLAVE connectors also includes the original MicroCLAVE and the antimicrobial MicroCLAVE.ICU Medical, based on its recent studies, expects this new generation MicroCLAVE Clear to be more efficient than the market competing products like the positive displacement MaxPlus ofCareFusion(CFN) or the negative displacement ClearLink byBaxter(BAX). The company with this launch thus expects solid growth and an increase in its market share in the competitive medical technology industry.The segments of ICU Medical include custom I.V. systems, closed delivery systems for hazardous drugs, needleless I.V. connectors, catheters and cardiac monitoring systems. In the past few years, the company is showing consistent year-over-year growth.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, revenue was up 8.3% year over year, aided by a better product mix in favor of higher value-added products. Also the company has started the product shipments from its newly established Slovakian plant.Additionally, the company is focusing on improved manufacturing facilities, quality controls, and research and development. It is also adopting several cost containment efforts like reduction in labor costs and investment in inventory.BAXTER INTL (BAX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCAREFUSION CORP (CFN): Free Stock Analysis ReportICU MEDICAL INC (ICUI): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

The New Jersey-based company stated that all of its employees in Japan are safe and its Tokyo office is undamaged.Becton's Japanese operations are led by its subsidiary Nippon Becton Dickinson Company, located in Tokyo, and a manufacturing and distribution facility in Fukushima. The company has temporality closed its manufacturing plant and distribution center in Fukushima prefecture while it assesses damage there.Becton is actively working with various non-profit disaster relief and humanitarian aid organizations, including American Red Cross and U.S. Fund for UNICEF, to assess Japan's need for healthcare products. The company has donated $325,000 as part of its relief efforts for victims of the disaster, which will be distributed among relief organizations.Becton is a world leader in safety needle products. The company faces a wide range of competitors, includingBaxter International(BAX), in each of its three business segments. Becton enjoys growing international sales and maintains a focus on geographical expansion into overseas markets, in particular, emerging markets, which account for over 20% of its sales. Japan contributed roughly 5% of its total sales in fiscal 2010.We remain cautious about Becton due to the lack of any major short-term catalyst. The rising demand for safety-needle was the primary driver of the company's growth in the past, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is mostly penetrated. Nevertheless, Becton anticipates that future sales will be driven by strong demand for its next-generation safety pen needles, which is expected to be launched in second-half fiscal 2011.We are optimistic that growth may recover in the future with the European Union adoption of safety needle requirements and recovery in research markets. Becton's preeminent global healthcare products franchise remains partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the healthcare delivery field.

Earnings for the quarter topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues fell short of forecast primarily due to a drop in domestic sales.As in the previous quarter, Becton, Dickinson again experienced higher growth in emerging markets, which accounted for over 20% of revenues.Among some noteworthy sub segments, Diabetes Care did well with sales shooting up 6.1% year over year. However, this was offset by lackluster performance by several business units, including Pharmaceutical Systems (down 15.3%), and Diagnostic Systems (down 2.6%).Despite indifferent results in the short term, Becton, Dickinson's long-term guidance remains robust. Both revenues and adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow at an encouraging pace till fiscal 2013. Furthermore, margins have improved following the company's cost containment and efficiency measures. Becton, Dickinson's cash flow remains strong and management is committed to efficiently deploying cash flow for increasing returns to shareholders through its sizeable share repurchase program.We remain cautious about Becton, Dickinson due to the lack of any major short-term catalyst. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is predominantly already penetrated. On the other hand, Becton, Dickinson anticipates that future sales will be driven by strong demand for its next-generation safety pen needles, which will be launched in the second half of the current fiscal year.We are hopeful that growth may recover in the future with the European Union adoption of safety needle requirements and recovery in research markets.

The license will be formally implemented by 13 European nations, including Germany, the U.K. and Spain, to render Preflucel widely available during the 2011-2012 influenza season.Preflucel, which is a seasonal vaccine comprised of inactivated and purified split influenza virions, is the outcome of a committed product development effort to provide a tolerable and useful vaccine that can be reliably manufactured during each and every influenza season. It is produced using Baxter's Vero cell technology, which ensures an innovative methodology for producing vaccine, versus the traditional embryonated chicken egg production.Preflucel is indicated as a prophylaxis of flu for adults including the elderly. It is deemed suitable for those who suffer from egg or antibiotic-related allergies. The vaccine is free of antibiotics, preservatives as well as egg proteins.Baxter is enthused by the approval of Preflucel in Austria. Also, a recent study pointed to tolerability and effectiveness of Preflucel as a safeguard against seasonal flu. It found 78.5% protective efficacy against the flu strains in the vaccine and relatively minor adverse event profile.The immunogenicity, safety and protective efficacy of Preflucel was established by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial conducted with over 7,200 fit volunteers, in the U.S., during the course of the 2008-2009 flu season.The news regarding Baxter remains mixed. On the positive side, Baxter's focus on life-sustaining products, which are not commoditized, partly insulates it from an economic downturn. The company is able to generate recurring revenues, and consistent cash flow, due to its focus on chronic diseases.On the flip side, despite recent improvement in Plasma Proteins and Antibody Therapy sub-segments, we are concerned about stagnation in sales, a still somber outlook for hospital spending and tightening of reimbursement.The lingering bearishness surrounding the stock can be lifted by consistent execution. Baxter is a good bet for value investors willing to wait as fundamentals improve. Among others, it competes withBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) andTalecris Biotherapeutics Holdings Corp.(TLCR) in certain niches.

305,6237,Earnings Scorecard: Becton - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/02/858490/earnings-scorecard-becton-ana,2011-02-14,BAX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Becton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) recently announced first-quarter fiscal 2011 (ended December 31) results. Adjusted (excluding one-time items) earnings per share of $1.35 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 and surpassed the year-ago figure of $1.30. Net income from continuing operations (on a reported basis) for the quarter increased 3.3% to roughly $314 million (or $1.35 a share).The Results in BriefBecton Dickinson recorded revenues of $1.84 billion for the reported quarter, down 1.4% (or 1.5% in constant currency) year over year, and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 billionDomestic sales for the quarter were $829 million, down 2.9% year over year, which includes a negative impact of 6% from the flu pandemic in the preceding year. Ex-U.S. revenues were $1.01 billion, down 0.2% (or 0.3% in constant currency), owing to a negative 3% impact from the flu pandemic. Becton, Dickinson experienced higher growth in emerging markets, which was offset by the slowdown in European markets.We have discussed the quarterly results at length here:Becton 1Q Mixed, Profit Inches UpAgreement – Estimate RevisionsThe overall trend in estimate revisions for fiscal 2011 is mixed, with a downward bias, following the release of the first quarter results. Out of the 19 analysts covering the stock, 4 raised their estimates over the past week while 7 lowered their forecasts.  A similar pattern applies for fiscal 2012 with 4 analysts (out of 18) raising their forecast and 8 lowering the same over the identical timeframe.The mixed sentiment was fueled by headwinds from several factors such as lack of positive triggers and lackluster sales growth.Loading...Loading...Magnitude – Consensus Estimate TrendDownward directional agreement, for the most past, has led to a 1 cent decline in the forecast for fiscal 2011 and a 4 cent drop for fiscal 2012. The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for fiscal 2011 and 2012 are $5.51 and $6.10, respectively, reflecting an estimated 12.5% and 10.67% year-over-year growth.Becton Dickinson Stays at NeutralBecton, Dickinson continues to forecast revenue growth of 4% year over year for fiscal 2011. The company still expects reported earnings per share from continuing operations to grow about 11% to 13% to a range of $5.45 to $5.55. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, for fiscal 2011, has been projected to grow in a band of 10% to 12%, unchanged from the earlier view.We remain cautious about Becton, Dickinson due to the lack of major short-term catalysts. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is predominantly already penetrated. Further, Becton, Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors in each of its three business segments.We are, however, hopeful that growth may recover in the future with the European Union adoption of safety requirements, recovery in research markets and continued growth in flow cytometry in the clinical setting. Becton, Dickinson's preeminent global healthcare products franchise is partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the healthcare delivery field.The company competes, in niches, with different companies such asBaxter International(BAX) among others.

Among the positive factors, Baxter retains a strong product pipeline with several products in late-stage clinical development.Highlights from the Fourth QuarterReported net income dropped 26% year over year, in the fourth quarter, to $423 million (or 72 cents per share). This decline mainly resulted from special after-tax charges of $227 million for asset impairment and costs related to Baxter's initiatives in the area of business optimization, higher reserves for litigation and in-process R&D expenses.Total revenues were $3,498 million, up 1% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,460 million. Domestic revenues for the quarter edged up 1% to $1,440 million while overseas sales were flat year over year (up 3% in constant currency) at $2,058 million.The Plasma Proteins business, where Baxter had encountered structural problems in the past, performed well with revenues of $416 million, up 9% (up 13% in constant currency) year over year. Antibody Therapy also delivered good results with sales of $386 million, climbing 10% (up 13% in constant currency) year over year.We have discussed the quarterly results at length here:Baxter Beats on EPS, Net DipsAgreement – Estimate RevisionsThe overall trend in estimate revisions for fiscal 2011 is essentially static since the release of the fourth quarter results with none of the analysts (out of 19) raising or lowering their estimates over the past 7 days. A similar pattern applies to the estimates for 2012.Average execution simply failed to evoke sentiment despite the company's retention of market share in infusion pumps and ongoing turnaround of the Plasma Proteins business.Loading...Loading...Magnitude – Consensus Estimate TrendA lack of movement in estimates has led to magnitude hitting a plateau for both the current and subsequent fiscal year.  The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for fiscal 2011 and 2012 are $4.20 and $4.64, respectively, reflecting an estimated 5.58% and 10.32% year-over-year growth.Baxter Stays at NeutralThe news regarding Baxter remains mixed.

Net income from continuing operations (on a reported basis) for the quarter increased 3.3% to about $314 million (or $1.35 a share).RevenuesBecton, Dickinson recorded revenues of $1.84 billion for the reported quarter, down 1.4% year over year (or 1.5% in constant currency), missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 billion.Domestic sales amounted to $829 million, down 2.9% year over year, including a negative impact of 6% from the flu pandemic in the preceding year. Ex-U.S. revenues were $1.01 billion, down 0.2% (or 0.3% in constant currency), including a negative impact of 3% from the flu pandemic in fiscal 2010. As in the previous quarter, Becton, Dickinson again experienced higher growth in emerging markets, which was offset by the slowdown in European markets.Segment-wise ResultsIn BD Medical, global revenues were $927 million, down 4.5% year over year (down 4.3% in constant currency) in the reported quarter. Higher revenues from Diabetes Care products were more than offset by an unfavorable comparison of 6% due to sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic in fiscal 2010.Among the sub-segments, Medical Surgical Systems was down 3.8% year over year (or 4.7% in constant currency) to $512.7 million in the first quarter, Diabetes Care was up 6.1% to $213.9 million and Pharmaceutical Systems dropped sharply by 15.3% (or 12.4% in constant currency) to $199.9 million.In BD Diagnostics, global sales were $602 million, up 1% (or 0.6% in constant currency). The performance of this segment was driven by robust revenues from Preanalytical Systems' safety-engineered products and Women's Health and Cancer items from the Diagnostic Systems unit. With regard to the sub-segments, Preanalytical Systems moved up 3.9% to $312.6 million and Diagnostic Systems dipped 2.6% to $289.1 million.In BD Biosciences, global sales were $314 million, up 3.7% (or 3.5% in constant currency). The favorable outcome was driven by cell analysis instrument as well as reagent sales. As for the sub-segments, Cell Analysis moved up 4.1% (or 4.2% in constant currency) to $240.7 million and Discovery Labware inched up 2.3% (or 1.2% in constant currency) to $73 million.Loading...Loading...MarginsGross margin edged up to 53% in the reported quarter from 52.1% a year ago while operating margin was 22.4%, lower than 23% in the prior-year quarter.Recent DevelopmentsOn February 7, 2011, Becton announced a definitive agreement to take over Accuri Cytometers, an Ann Arbor-based company, which makes personal flow cytometers for use by researchers.  The acquisition, whose terms were not disclosed, is synergistic with Becton's strategy for its Cell Analysis sub-segment.OutlookBecton Dickinson continues to forecast revenue growth of 4% year over year for fiscal 2011.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is $1.29, representing an estimated year-over-year decline of 1.11%.During the fourth quarter earnings announcement, the company had guided reported earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 to grow about 11% to 13% to a range of $5.45 to $5.55. It expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to grow in a band of 10% to 12% for fiscal 2011. During the last conference call, Becton Dickinson added that it forecasts fiscal 2011 revenues to increase about 4% year over year.Fourth-Quarter RecapBecton Dickinson reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2010 earnings of $1.24 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Total revenues increased 1% year over year (2.9% in constant currency) to $1.87 billion, with growth varying somewhat across business segments. Revenues were mostly in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Domestic sales for the quarter amounted to $832 million, up 1.4% year over year, including a negative impact of 1.8% from the flu pandemic. Overseas revenues were $1.04 billion, up 0.8% (or 4.2% in constant currency), including a negative impact of 4% from the flu pandemic in fiscal 2009. Becton Dickinson experienced higher growth in emerging markets, offset by a slowdown in European markets.Estimate Revision TrendLoading...Loading...AgreementThe overall trend in estimate revisions for the upcoming quarter is relatively static. Of the 16 analysts covering the stock, there was no upward revision during the past 7 days accompanied by just one downward movement. Two analysts raised their estimates in the past month while two lowered their forecasts.With regard to fiscal 2011, only one analyst (out of 17) lifted his/her estimate over the last week with no reverse movements. Over the past month, four analysts have raised their estimates while one moved in the opposite direction. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2011 is $5.52, reflecting an estimated 12.7% year-over-year growth.MagnitudeGiven the relative lack of estimate revisions, the magnitude of revision reached a plateau, for both the past 7 and 30 days, for the forthcoming quarter. There was an increase of a cent over the past month for fiscal 2011.Our Take on Becton DickinsonBecton Dickinson, a leading global medical technology company, produces and markets medical devices, instrument systems and reagents. The company is dedicated to enhancing drug delivery, improving the pace of diagnosing infectious diseases and cancer and advancing R&D for new drugs.We remain cautious about Becton Dickinson due to the lack of any major short-term catalyst. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is predominantly already penetrated. Further, Becton Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors in each of its three business segments.We are, however, hopeful that growth may recover in the future with the European Union adoption of safety requirements, recovery in research markets and continued growth in flow cytometry in the clinical setting. Becton Dickinson's preeminent global healthcare products franchise is partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the healthcare delivery field.Cash flow of the company remains strong and management is committed to efficiently deploying cash flow for increasing returns to shareholders through its share repurchase program.The company competes, in niches, with different companies such asBaxter International(BAX) among others.

This raises the annual dividend to 90 cents per share from the current payout of 80 cents. The revised quarterly dividend is payable on November 4, 2011, to shareholders of record as on October 13, 2011.The dividend increase underscores Covidien's commitment to deliver incremental returns to investors leveraging a solid free cash flow and strong earnings. The company's previous dividend increase was in September 2010, when it raised the quarterly payout by 11% to 20 cents a share from 18 cents.Covidien continues to maintain a streak of positive earnings surprises having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. The company posted solid third-quarter fiscal 2011 results with both revenues and earnings outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimates on the back of solid growth in its core Medical Devices business.Covidien is enhancing shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases. The company's Board, in August 2011, authorized a share buyback program allowing it to repurchase up to $2 billion of its ordinary shares, representing an encouraging prospect for earnings growth in fiscal 2012.The company has returned more than $1 billion to its shareholders (in the form of dividend and share repurchase) over the past twelve months, representing over 50% of its free cash flows, well above its target of 25%–40%.Covidien boasts a well diversified product and technology portfolio.

The portable device dubbed “ReVel” is geared for pediatric and adult patients requiring breathing support during transport.The ReVel is CareFusion's second palm top ventilator. The company, in December 2010, introduced the EnVe ventilator, the first in this category. Both these ventilators are engineered with the company's proprietary “ActivCore” gas delivery system. The palm top ventilator technology offers high-end critical care ventilation and freedom from wall-air systems.The ReVel ventilator, which complements the company's alternate care offerings (includes emergency and military respiratory care), is designed to help physicians improve patient care, optimize ventilator therapy and cut costs. It has the ability to manage most critical and non-invasively ventilated patients from the point of emergency through the hospital, allowing potentially life-saving ventilation during transit.Moreover, the new ventilator offers monitoring and clinical tools to help physicians better manage andcare for patients. Its Spontaneous Breathing Trial (“SBT”) technology provides data which enables clinicians to safely detach patients from ventilation at the right time. The ReVel ventilator is also equipped with an integrated pulse oximeter for monitoring a patient's pulse rate and oxygen saturation level during transport.The device weighs just 9.5 pounds compared with conventional systems which weigh more than 20 pounds.

The company posted solid third-quarter fiscal 2011 results with both revenues and earnings outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimates riding on solid growth in its  Medical Devices business.Revenues for the quarter soared 14% year over year as healthy double-digit growth in the Medical Devices segment more than neutralized the sustained weakness at the company's Pharmaceuticals division.Covidien is a leading global health care products company that develops and markets medical solutions for better patient outcomes. It has a rich history of developing and manufacturing high-quality products in a cost-effective manner. The company boasts of a well diversified product and technology portfolio. Covidien competes withJohnson & Johnson(JNJ),Becton Dickinson(BDX) andC.R. Bard(BCR), among others.Covidien is expanding its footprint in emerging markets, notably in Asia and Latin America, and boosting market share in core segments through investments in sales and marketing infrastructure. Moreover, the company continues to roll out new products and technologies, focusing on faster-growing products and markets, and broadening its product range through acquisition and strategic collaborations.The acquisition of vascular devices maker ev3 has pushed the company's leadership up in the endovascular devices market giving it a strong foothold in both the peripheral vascular and neurovascular sub-segments.Covidien remains committed to delivering incremental returns to investors leveraging solid free cash flows and strong earnings power. The company recently announced a restructuring program across its three business segments, aimed at boosting its cost structure. Cost savings from the restructuring should help it improve margins and profitability.Covidien is well placed to achieve its long-term revenue and earnings growth targets based on its attractive fundamentals, effective execution, new product cycle, synergies of acquisitions and expansion into emerging markets. Moreover, its share buyback initiative is accretive to earnings.However, we are concerned about intense competition, reimbursement uncertainty and the sustained pricing and procedure volume pressure, which may impinge on theperformance of the company's core Medical Devices business. Rising raw material costs also represents a headwind.Covidien's guidance for fiscal 2012 does not impress much, as projected sales appear to decelerate on a year-over-year basis.

400,7890,Becton's New Safety Catheter - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/09/1937950/bectons-new-safety-catheter-,2011-09-22,BDX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Leading global medical technology companyBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) recently revealed that its BD Medical segment is now supplying next generation safety short peripheral IV catheter (“SPIVC”) know how. This technology is intended to protect healthcare workers from injuries via needlestick and exposure to blood. In other words, it is geared to safeguard technicians from the risk of infection from pathogens in the blood.In addition to protection from needlestick injuries, one study found that theBD Insyte Autoguard BC with Blood Control Technologycuts down on the risk of exposure to blood by 95%, compared with a non-blood control IV catheter. This latest blood control know-how is a septum within the catheter hub intended to prevent blood from spilling out during insertion of the catheter.Lab technicians encounter leakage of blood in almost 40% of cases. This latest safety catheter from Becton is geared to cut down on the risk of exposure to mucocutaneous blood. Mucocutaneous exposure refers to body fluid exposure to the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, eyes or skin. Becton's latest product should also reduce contamination by blood of other surfaces such as floors and beds.More information on the new BD Insyte Autoguard BC with Blood Control Technology may be obtained from company web-sites and phone numbers.SPIVCs are common devices utilized to access blood vessels. According to several released studies, as many as 37.8% of healthcare technicians reported that they faced at least one instance of exposure to body fluid or blood over the past year. One study found that nurses face the highest risk.We remain cautious about Becton Dickinson due to the lack of major short-term catalysts. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is already largely penetrated. On the positive side, Becton Dickinson's preeminent global healthcare products franchise is partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the healthcare delivery field.Becton Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors, includingBaxter International(BAX) in certain niches, in each of its three business segments.

411,7901,Becton to Fight Cervical Cancer - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/09/1922944/becton-to-fight-cervical-can,2011-09-16,BDX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Leading global medical technology companyBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) recently disclosed its commitment to “Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon”, in an effort to exploit private and public investments in worldwide healthcare. Their focus will be to fight breast and cervical cancer. Leadership will be provided by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (“PEPFAR”), George W. Bush Institute, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and Susan G. Komen for the Cure.Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon is an effort to harness private and public investments in healthcare to fight breast and cervical cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. The organization will increase the availability of cervical cancer monitoring and treatment among at-risk women in less developed nations. The effort will harness the platform of the PEPFAR model. Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon has received commitment for $80 million for 5 years.Cervical cancer is a major killer among young women in the less developed nations. It is the third most frequently occurring cancer among women and the most common in Africa. Cervical cancer is also widely prevalent in certain parts of Latin America. Over 85% of the worldwide burden from cervical cancer occurs in the developing world, where it constitutes 13% of all cancers striking women; yet, less than 5% of the afflicted have access to screening even once in their lives.Becton Dickinson's cervical cancer diagnostic methodologies use liquid-based cytology, a process of readying cervical cells for scrutiny in a lab. The centrifuging mechanism in liquid-based cytology leads to better samples which are easier for lab technicians to analyze.Becton Dickinson will support Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon to provide sustainable and dispersed access to modern cancer diagnostic know-how for patients residing in nations aided by PEPFAR. To achieve its purpose, Becton Dickinson will provide steeply discounted pricing on critical cervical cancer diagnostic tests in low income nations.The discount may be quantified at about $10 million for every 1 million women tested. In addition, Becton Dickinson will impart training to lab technicians on screening for cervical cancer. It will also cooperate with Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon staff to formulate country-based guidelines for proper screening modalities.For its part, a spokesperson for Becton Dickinson stated that the company shares a vision with U.S. Government, UNAIDS and The George W. Bush Institute to fight cervical cancer. A representative of the George W. Bush Institute said that one of its goals is to cut down mortality from cervical cancer by about 25% among women monitored and treated under this initiative.Based on the anticipated favorable foreign exchange impact, Becton Dickinson has hiked its revenue and earnings forecasts for fiscal 2011. The company now expects sales for the year to grow near the higher end of its previously communicated range of 5% to 6% year over year. On a currency neutral basis, sales are expected to increase by about 3% (versus 3.5% earlier) on account of lower sales in Western Europe.Moreover, the company has raised its earnings per share (on a reported basis) from continuing operations to a new range of $5.65 to $5.70 from its prior view of $5.55 to $5.65, reflecting about 15% to 16% year-over-year growth. Earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 are expected to be 14% to 15% higher than adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.94 in fiscal 2010.We remain cautious about Becton Dickinson due to the lack of major short-term catalysts. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is already largely penetrated. On the positive side, Becton Dickinson's pre-eminent global healthcare products franchise is partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the healthcare delivery field.Becton Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors, includingBaxter International(BAX) in certain niches, in each of its three business segments. We currently have a long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock, backed by a short-term Zacks #3 Rank (Hold).BAXTER INTL (BAX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."
412,7902,Unilife Develops Self-infusion System - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/09/1917283/unilife-develops-self-infusi,2011-09-14,BDX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Retractable syringes makerUnilife Corporation(UNIS) reported that it has developed the AutoInfusor subcutaneous (under the skin) infusion systems. It is the world's first and only automated subcutaneous infusion system geared for patient self-administration of drugs with dose volumes between 3mL (milliliter) and 10mL.The single-use, wearable, AutoInfusors drug delivery systems are intended for simple and convenient use by patients. These breakthrough infusion systems can be customized to meet the specific requirement of the drug and its target patient.Once a patient attaches the AutoInfusors system to the injection site and presses the activation button, the device commences the delivery of the drug into the subcutaneous tissue. The patient can continue his/her normal activities during the dose delivery period. The audio-visualindicators notifythe patient about the completion of full dose delivery, following which, the device can be removed from the body and conveniently disposed.Currently, a number of drugs, developed by pharma companies, feature complex formulation and require large volumes of doses. The traditional patch pumps for drug delivery are mostly unsuitable for delivering these medications. So far, pharma companies had lack of access to a single-use subcutaneous infusionsystem that allow patientsto conveniently self-administer doses higher than 3mL.Unilife has designed the AutoInfusor systems to address the unmet needs of pharma and biotechnology companies for drugs that have complex formulations and require large dose volumes. The company noted that the product is now available for supply to pharma companies for human clinical studies in both pre-filled and fill-at-time-of-use formats.Unilife develops and markets advanced drug delivery systems. It collaborates with biotech and pharmaceutical companies and explores new devices that could be used with their drugs. The company has developed a wide array of its own injectable drug delivery products, including retractable syringes.Unilife markets its prefilled syringes to pharmaceutical manufacturers, suppliers of medical products to healthcare facilities and patients who self-administer prescription drugs. Its patented syringes provide integrated safety, which is designed to protect patients from needle-stick injuries.

413,7903,Covidien Unfolds FY12 View - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/09/1915120/covidien-unfolds-fy12-view-a,2011-09-13,BDX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Leading healthcare products makerCovidien plc(COV) has revealed its financial forecast for fiscal 2012. In a recent investor meet, the Ireland-based company stated that it envisages net salesfor the year to leap 3%-5% year over year (assuming current foreign exchange rates).This indicates a slowdown from the company's current expected sales growth of 8%-11% in fiscal 2011. The current Zacks ConsensusEstimatesfor revenues for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 are $11.53 billion and $12.04 billion, respectively.The company anticipates revenues from Medical Devices, its principal growth engine, to grow 4%-7% year over year in fiscal 2012. That points to a considerable deceleration from the projected growth of 13%-16% for the division in fiscal 2011. Sustained pricing pressure and a still choppy procedure volume environment (given patient deferrals due to high unemployment) are hurtingCovidien.On a positive note, Covidien expects sales from its Pharmaceuticals segment to move up 2%-5% in fiscal 2012, reversing a sluggish trend witnessed in the current fiscal. Revenues from this segment are expected to be flat to down 3% in fiscal 2011. Revenues from the Medical Supplies division are expected to be flat year over year in fiscal 2012.Adjusted (excluding one-time items) operating margin for fiscal 2012 has been forecast in the band of 22%-23%, mostly in line with the company's expectation for the current fiscal year.

415,7905,Medical Devices Stock Outlook - Sept. 2011 - Industry Outlook,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/09/1905395/medical-devices-stock-outloo,2011-09-07,BDX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...June quarter results mostly mirror the preceding quarter as a host of macro headwinds (including price and procedure volume pressures) continued to haunt the MedTech industry and weighed on the performance of the incumbent players. Although a number of these issues are expected to linger over the second-half of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The highly-regulated medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest-growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies, given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling health care costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.An increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from healthc are reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011.Recently, in a bid to curb the nation's bloated budget deficit, the Obama administration has passed a bill which includes plans to cut health care expenditure. Under the bill, a 12-person bipartisan panel was created to recommend a sharp reduction in spending on government programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Medicare and Medicaid, which account for about 20% of the federal budget, represent a key target of the deficit-reduction plan. The bill aims to cut $2.4 trillion in federal government spending over the next decade.Federal budgetary pressure (given a potential reduction in U.S. government's health care spending) has raised reimbursement risk as payors may more actively pursue their cost reduction initiatives. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical devices companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – Changes on the Horizon?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices (to include devices such as infusion pumps) under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies. President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.In a shocking move, in late July 2011, the IOM recommended the FDA scrap the 510(k) process and replace it with a new regulatory framework that integrates pre-market clearance and better post-market surveillance. The IOM review concluded that the 510(k) process fails to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class II devices before they enter the market. The recommendation was met with immediate industry-wide criticism.However, the FDA noted that the IOM's recommendation is not binding and the 510(k) process should not be eliminated. The regulator is currently seeking public feedback on the proposal (a meeting scheduled in mid-September 2011) with plans in place to decide on potential changes in late September/early October 2011.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still-soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.Loading...Loading...These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro and radiation oncology products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD) andVarian Medical(VAR).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space.Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: A Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a spate of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well-positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies have a number of levers to pull and represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed weakness in its ICD business in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market. The company saw all-round growth during the second quarter, outstripping its own guidance, although the CRM segment remains challenging. After several quarters, growth in the Cardiovascular portfolio came as a pleasant surprise. Based on a strong quarter, the company raised its guidance for 2011. We recently upgraded the stock to Outperform.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify devices are already gaining notable traction.Several new products (including the quadripolar CRT-D systems) should boost the company's CRM share in 2011, despite the weak market conditions. However, we do account for the fact that approval of the highly-anticipated quadripolar CRT-D, has been pushed back to early fourth-quarter 2011 from mid-2011.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the second quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Apart from heart valve therapy, healthy growth at the critical care segment (led by Flotrac systems and pressure monitoring products) is also encouraging.Moreover, Edwards's robust balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Following the favorable recommendation of the FDA Advisory Panel for Sapien THV (for inoperable patients), the company is confident of receiving final approval by October 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.Another value proposition is robotic surgical systems makerIntuitive Surgical(ISRG). Intuitive's recurring revenue stream continues to grow and provides a shield against cyclicality of revenues, arising from the sale of discretionary capital equipment to hospitals. We believe that its da Vinci surgery system has the capacity to improve outcomes and cut down on procedure time.We expect a number of procedures that are currently completed either in an open surgical manner or with laparoscopy to be eventually replaced by da Vinci surgery, as robotic surgery becomes the standard of care in many instances. The company enjoys a virtual monopoly in robotic surgery with little competition. Intuitive expects total procedure count to increase in the band of 27%-29% year over year in fiscal 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools. Moreover, the company is also buying Sweden-based blood test systems maker Phadia for $3.5 billion.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage(LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude has registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. The company expects to commence the European clinical trial of Portico valve in late 2011 (launch expected by first-half 2013). Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for companies such asVolcano Corp.(VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession.However, results from the first two quarters of 2011 indicate a silver lining stemming from continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. A healthy replacement/upgrade cycle may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESImpact of Japan DebacleThe impact of the horrific March 11 earthquake in Japan and its aftermath has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products.Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region. U.S. medical devices firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.Medtronic,Boston ScientificandJohnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis, which is hard to gauge at this moment.A Still Clouded Orthopedic OutlookWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. The reconstructive market fundamentals (pricing and volume) remains challenging with little or no clear visibility for a material turnaround in second-half 2011.Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). We remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine Continues to HurtThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their results for the first two quarters of 2011.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market through 2011. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilizing but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy and reimbursement-related pushback.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe.The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010. Volume headwind is likely to sustain through the back half of 2011 as unemployment continues to influence procedure deferrals.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Most of the leading players in the orthopedic space reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter, echoing a general softness in the market.June quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although stabilized sequentially) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportINTUITIVE SURG (ISRG): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportTHERMO FISHER (TMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportVOLCANO CORP (VOLC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

These companies have a number of levers to pull and represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed weakness in its ICD business in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market. The company saw all-round growth during the second quarter, outstripping its own guidance, although the CRM segment remains challenging. After several quarters, growth in the Cardiovascular portfolio came as a pleasant surprise. Based on a strong quarter, the company raised its guidance for 2011. We recently upgraded the stock to Outperform.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify devices are already gaining notable traction.Several new products (including the quadripolar CRT-D systems) should boost the company's CRM share in 2011, despite the weak market conditions. However, we do account for the fact that approval of the highly-anticipated quadripolar CRT-D, has been pushed back to early fourth-quarter 2011 from mid-2011.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the second quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Apart from heart valve therapy, healthy growth at the critical care segment (led by Flotrac systems and pressure monitoring products) is also encouraging.Moreover, Edwards's robust balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Following the favorable recommendation of the FDA Advisory Panel for Sapien THV (for inoperable patients), the company is confident of receiving final approval by October 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.Another value proposition is robotic surgical systems makerIntuitive Surgical(ISRG). Intuitive's recurring revenue stream continues to grow and provides a shield against cyclicality of revenues, arising from the sale of discretionary capital equipment to hospitals. We believe that its da Vinci surgery system has the capacity to improve outcomes and cut down on procedure time.We expect a number of procedures that are currently completed either in an open surgical manner or with laparoscopy to be eventually replaced by da Vinci surgery, as robotic surgery becomes the standard of care in many instances. The company enjoys a virtual monopoly in robotic surgery with little competition. Intuitive expects total procedure count to increase in the band of 27%-29% year over year in fiscal 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools. Moreover, the company is also buying Sweden-based blood test systems maker Phadia for $3.5 billion.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage(LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude has registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. The company expects to commence the European clinical trial of Portico valve in late 2011 (launch expected by first-half 2013). Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for companies such asVolcano Corp.(VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession.However, results from the first two quarters of 2011 indicate a silver lining stemming from continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. A healthy replacement/upgrade cycle may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESImpact of Japan DebacleThe impact of the horrific March 11 earthquake in Japan and its aftermath has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products.Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region. U.S. medical devices firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.Medtronic,Boston ScientificandJohnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis, which is hard to gauge at this moment.A Still Clouded Orthopedic OutlookWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. The reconstructive market fundamentals (pricing and volume) remains challenging with little or no clear visibility for a material turnaround in second-half 2011.Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). We remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine Continues to HurtThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their results for the first two quarters of 2011.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market through 2011. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilizing but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy and reimbursement-related pushback.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe.The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010. Volume headwind is likely to sustain through the back half of 2011 as unemployment continues to influence procedure deferrals.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Most of the leading players in the orthopedic space reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter, echoing a general softness in the market.June quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although stabilized sequentially) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportINTUITIVE SURG (ISRG): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportTHERMO FISHER (TMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportVOLCANO CORP (VOLC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."
417,7907,Medical Devices Stock Outlook - Sept. 2011 - Industry Outlook,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/09/1905470/medical-devices-stock-outloo,2011-09-07,BDX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...June quarter results mostly mirror the preceding quarter as a host of macro headwinds (including price and procedure volume pressures) continued to haunt the MedTech industry and weighed on the performance of the incumbent players. Although a number of these issues are expected to linger over the second-half of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The highly-regulated medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest-growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies, given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling health care costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.An increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from healthc are reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011.Recently, in a bid to curb the nation's bloated budget deficit, the Obama administration has passed a bill which includes plans to cut health care expenditure. Under the bill, a 12-person bipartisan panel was created to recommend a sharp reduction in spending on government programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Medicare and Medicaid, which account for about 20% of the federal budget, represent a key target of the deficit-reduction plan. The bill aims to cut $2.4 trillion in federal government spending over the next decade.Federal budgetary pressure (given a potential reduction in U.S. government's health care spending) has raised reimbursement risk as payors may more actively pursue their cost reduction initiatives. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical devices companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – Changes on the Horizon?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices (to include devices such as infusion pumps) under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies. President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.In a shocking move, in late July 2011, the IOM recommended the FDA scrap the 510(k) process and replace it with a new regulatory framework that integrates pre-market clearance and better post-market surveillance. The IOM review concluded that the 510(k) process fails to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class II devices before they enter the market. The recommendation was met with immediate industry-wide criticism.However, the FDA noted that the IOM's recommendation is not binding and the 510(k) process should not be eliminated. The regulator is currently seeking public feedback on the proposal (a meeting scheduled in mid-September 2011) with plans in place to decide on potential changes in late September/early October 2011.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still-soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.Loading...Loading...These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro and radiation oncology products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD) andVarian Medical(VAR).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space.Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: A Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a spate of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well-positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth.

As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportINTUITIVE SURG (ISRG): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportTHERMO FISHER (TMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportVOLCANO CORP (VOLC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

The Cincinnati-based company envisions net sales for the year in the range of $183 million to $192 million with earnings per share expected between 85 cents and 89 cents.Net income for fiscal 2012 has been projected to shoot up between 20% and 30% year over year (excluding reorganization charges in fiscal 2011). The guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions which Meridian may complete during the year.However, Meridian expects its full year fiscal 2011 results to come in at the low-end of its current forecasted range of $160 million to $163 million. The company, in July 2011, chopped its revenues and earnings forecast for fiscal 2011 based on sustained weakness across its Life Science and European Diagnostics businesses.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are $162 million and 70 cents, respectively, for fiscal 2011 and $185 million and 87 cents, respectively, for fiscal 2012.Meridian specializes in developing diagnostic test kits for multiple serious and infectious diseases. Its acquisition of London-based molecular biology reagents maker Bioline has unlocked opportunities for growth through expanded product range and geographic expansion. Meridian's diagnostics business faces strong competition fromAbbott Laboratories(ABT),Becton, Dickinson and Company(BDX),Thermo Fisher(TMO) andSiemens(SI).Meridian hopes sales in fiscal 2012 will be boosted by its new molecular testillumigeneand Bioline products as well as its foodborne andH. pyloritests. The company is optimistic that sustained adoption of theillumigeneplatform, growth in core products and opportunities in Europe will help it drive significant growth in sales and earnings in fiscal 2012 and beyond. Moreover, the company is evaluating opportunities for suitable acquisitions.The company noted that its fiscal 2012 outlook includes full year sales from itsC. difficiletestillumigeneas well as revenues fromillumigeneGBS (for Group Bstreptococcus), its second molecular test, which is currently awaiting U.S. approval with a launch expected in first-quarter 2012.Moreover, Meridian expects modest sales from itsillumigene Mycoplasma pneumoniaetest in fiscal 2012, which is likely to be launched overseas inthe second quarter.

The transaction is expected to be completed after antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions.Colorado-based Baxa, develops pharmacy technology for safe and effective preparation and delivery of oral and intravenous drugs. The entity generated sales of roughly $150 million in 2010. Baxa's broad product/solution range include the ExactaMix compounder, an automated compounding system, and the DoseEdge pharmacy workflow manager, an integrated system for managing oral and intravenous dose preparation.The acquisition bodes well for Baxter as the addition of Baxa's products will complement its nutrition products and drug delivery systems. With these new products, the company will be able to offer a complete solution to meet the nutritional needs of the majority of patients.Nutrition is regarded as a key element of therapy and both the entities are committed to advancing the delivery of intravenous nutrition leveraging their novel technologies. Baxter expects the deal to be neutral to its 2012 earnings and accretive afterwards.Baxter is a leading global medical products and services company that develops, manufactures and markets products to treat hemophilia (a bleeding disorder), kidney and infectious diseases. Itsmedical products business offers products (including multi-chamber containers and premixed drugs and drug-reconstitution systems) used in the delivery of drugs and fluids to patients. Baxter competes withBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) andJohnson & Johnson(JNJ), among others.Baxter's products are primarily life-sustaining, which partly insulates it against economic downturns. The company is able to generate recurring revenues, and consistent cash flow, due toits focus on chronic diseases.On the other hand, despite recent improvement in Plasma Proteins and Antibody Therapy sub-segments, we are concerned about stagnation in sales, a slightly somber outlook for some hospital spending and tightening of reimbursement.

The Pennsylvania-based company is also patenting for the new device.Unifill EZMix is the world's first and only dual or multi-chamber prefilled syringe with a built-in safety mechanism. It comprises two or more drug containers within a single glass barrel to store liquid stable or lyophilized drugs and diluent for reconstitution. The device boasts of an automatic safety feature fully integrated within the glass barrel aimed at preventing healthcare workers from needle-stick injuries.According to Unilife, the device will be marketed with either a fixed needle for drugs indicated for subcutaneous (under the skin) injections or with attachable needles (up to 1.5 inches in length).Unifill EZMix has been geared to address the unmet needs of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a convenient delivery system for the reconstitution and administration of lyophilized drugs and vaccines. The users can simply advance the plunger to mix the lyophilized powder with the diluent before swirling the syringe to complete reconstitution.Prefilled syringes act as the device of choice for the administration of injectable vaccines and drugs that are marketed by over 20 pharmaceutical companies. Unilife is of the opinion that the pharma market for prefilled syringes is the most rapidly growing, relatively uncongested and most lucrative segment of the global syringe industry.Unilife develops and markets advanced drug delivery systems. It collaborates with biotech and pharmaceutical companies and explores new devices that could be used with their drugs. The company has developed a wide array of its own injectable drug delivery products, including retractable syringes.Unilife markets its prefilled syringes to pharmaceutical manufacturers, suppliers of medical products to healthcare facilities and patients who self-administer prescription drugs. Its patented syringes provide integrated safety, which is designed to protect patients from needle-stick injuries.

Under the new arrangement, the company's diagnostic products will be sold in that country through its direct sales force. Meridian noted that it is switching the sales model for these products from distributors-based to direct sales through Bioline Australia.Bioline Australia is a leading developer and distributor of molecular biology reagents for the life science, pharmaceutical and commercial diagnostic markets. The integration of Bioline Australia's polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) reagents with Meridian's diagnostic tests for infectious diseases (including the new molecular testillumigene) is expected to offer a unique, broad product range to customers in these markets. Moreover, distribution of both product lines through a single source will enhance the opportunities to attract new customers.Meridian specializes in developing diagnostic test kits for multiple serious and infectious diseases. The company's diagnostics business faces strong competition fromAbbott Laboratories(ABT),Becton, Dickinson and Company(BDX),Thermo Fisher(TMO) andSiemens(SI).The Cincinnati-based company's $23.3 million acquisition of London-based molecular biology reagents maker Bioline in July 2010 has unlocked opportunities for growth through expanded product range and geographic expansion.Meridian's revenues surged roughly 18% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2011 (ended June 30), buoyed by healthy performance of its core U.S. Diagnostics business. Sales from its Life Science segment propelled 47.5% with the Bioline acquisition strongly contributing to the growth. The company'sC. difficiletestillumigeneis gaining strong traction having achieved roughly 500 placements globally till date.Meridian hopes sales in fiscal 2012 will be boosted byillumigeneandnew products.Illumigene, which represents Meridian's response to growing competition, is expected to be its principal growth engine in the years ahead.ABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportSIEMENS AG-ADR (SI): Free Stock Analysis ReportTHERMO FISHER (TMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportMERIDIAN BIOSCI (VIVO): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

This represents a major landmark in the California-based company's endeavor to make this breakthrough product available to the global lab community.The PANTHER system complements Gen-Probe's TIGRIS system, the first fully automated testing system for molecular diagnostics. The company has developed several assays designed to run on the PANTHER system including its market-leading chlamydia and gonorrhea test APTIMA COMBO 2.The PANTHER system aimed at low-to-mid volume labs features a sample-in, sample-out model. It allows an operator to process 275 samples in eight hours, generating 550 chlamydia and gonorrhea results with the APTIMA Combo 2 assay. For larger customers, the PANTHER system can process 500 samples and yield 1,000 results in twelve hours.Gen-Probe believes that PANTHER will significantly contribute to its revenue growth in the years ahead as it broadens the testing menu for the instrument. It will allow the company to reinforce its presence in the lab community.Gen-Probe, in May 2011, submitted a 510 (k) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the PANTHER system. The company received the European CE mark for the instrument in December 2010.Gen-Probe is a dominant player in the rapidly expanding nucleic acid test (“NAT”) market, the fastest growing segment of the clinical diagnostic market. It is a market leader in domestic gonorrhea and chlamydia testing with its PACE and APTIMA assay product lines. Gen-Probe competes with more established firms in the molecular diagnostic industry such asRoche(RHHBY),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andAbbott Labs(ABT).We believe Gen-Probe is well placed with a slew of new products that are expected to be the harbinger of growth in the years ahead. Moreover, the ongoing market shift away from traditional diagnostic methods (such as antibody-based assays) towards molecular testing represents a tailwind for the company. However, the company's struggling blood screening business is expected to remain under pressure due to lower instrument sales to partnerNovartis(NVS).

The new test broadens the Cincinnati-based company's portfolio ofC. difficiletests and underscores its sustained commitment to bring out breakthrough products for the detectionofC. difficile.C. difficileis a highly drug-resistant bacterium, which exists in the environment in spore (or inactive) form and produces a toxin that causes diarrhea and more serious intestinal conditions such as colitis.C. difficilespores are frequently found in hospitals, nursing homes and extended care facilities. Although spores cannot cause infection directly, they transform into the active (or infectious) form when ingested.The prevalence ofC. difficilehas been growing at a brisk rate over the past few years. Study reveals that more than 7,000 patients in a hospital environment are prone to get affected byC. difficileeach day with an estimated associated healthcare cost ranging between $18 million and $52 million per day.ImmunoCardC. difficileGDH is geared to detect a common antigen, known as Glutamate dehydrogenase, produced by the toxigenic and non-toxigenic forms ofC. difficile bacteria.The toxic forms of the bacteria are generally associated with hospital and community-acquired diarrhea and can cause a life-threatening inflammation of the colon. The new test is intended for use by clinical laboratories for screening patients with diarrhea forC. difficile.Meridian specializes in developing diagnostic test kits for multiple serious and infectious diseases. The company launched its first GHD test, the ImmunoCardC. difficileGDH, in 1993.

Among the positive factors, Baxter retains a strong product pipeline with several products in late-stage clinical development.Highlights from the Second QuarterReported net income increased to $615 million (or $1.07 per share) versus $535 million (or 90 cents a share) a year ago.Total revenues were $3,536 million, up 11% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,378 million. U.S. revenues for the quarter jumped 5% to $1,418 million while ex-U.S. sales were higher 15% (up 7% in constant currency) to $2,118 million.The Plasma Proteins business, where Baxter had encountered structural problems in the past, performed well with revenues of $363 million, up 16% (up 11% in constant currency) year over year. Antibody Therapy also delivered good results with sales of $381 million, climbing 23% (up 21% in constant currency) year over year.We have discussed the quarterly results at length here:Baxter Beats Easily, Ups ViewAgreement – Estimate RevisionsThe overall trend in estimate revisions for fiscal 2011 is overwhelmingly positive since the release of the second quarter results. Out of a total of 17 analysts covering the stock, 15 have raised their estimates over the past month with no instance of downward revision. Likewise, 11 analysts (out of a total of 19) have raised their forecasts for 2012 over the past month with only 1 lowering his/her estimate. There was no movement at all in either direction, over the past week, for either 2011 or 2012. Improved execution by the company led to the positive outlook for the coming years.Loading...Loading...Magnitude – Consensus Estimate TrendUpward estimate revisions, accompanied by directional agreement for the most part, have led to a rise in annual forecasts for Baxter. Estimates for 2011 and 2012 have gone up by 4 cents each, over the past 30 days. Estimates for 2011 and 2012 have been flat, over the past 7 days.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2011 is $4.30, reflecting an estimated 8.03% year-over-year growth.Baxter Stays at NeutralBaxter issued its guidance for third-quarter fiscal 2011 and raised its earnings estimates for 2011. For the third quarter, the company expects growth in revenues in the range of 3% to 4% in constant currency and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.07 to $1.09.For fiscal 2011, Baxter still anticipates growth in revenues in the range of 3% to 4% in constant currency and raised expectations for adjusted earnings per share to a band of $4.27 and $4.32 (earlier $4.20 and $4.28). In addition, the company forecasts cash flow from operations of about $2.8 billion.The news regarding Baxter still remains mixed. On the positive side, Baxter's focus on life-sustaining products, which are not commoditized, partly insulates it from an economic downturn. The company is able to generate recurring revenues, and consistent cash flow, due to its focus on chronic diseases.On the flip side, despite recent improvement in Plasma Proteins and Antibody Therapy sub-segments, we are concerned about stagnation in sales, a slightly somber outlook for some hospital spending and tightening of reimbursement.Improved execution has lifted sentiment somewhat toward Baxter. Baxter is a good bet for value investors willing to wait as fundamentals improve further. Among others, it competes withBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) in certain niches. We currently have a long-term Neutral rating on Baxter.About Earnings Estimate ScorecardLen Zacks, PhD in mathematics from MIT, proved over 30 years ago that earnings estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices.

International sales were driven by sustained healthy growth in emerging markets, partly ebbed by the slowdown in Western European markets due to the weak economy.Segment ReviewAt BD Medical, Becton's largest division, global revenues climbed 10.5% (or 4.9% in constant currency) year over year to $1,045 million, driven by healthy revenues from Diabetes Care, Pharmaceutical Systems products and safety items.Within BD Medical, revenues from Medical Surgical Systems increased 7.2% year over year to $529 million. Diabetes Care sales jumped 11.7% to $220.2 million while Pharmaceutical Systems revenues soared 16% to $295.6 million.At BD Diagnostics, global sales increased 9.6% (or 4.8% in constant currency) year over year to $631 million, bolstered by healthy revenues from Preanalytical Systems' safety-engineered products and solid Diagnostic Systems sales. Preanalytical Systems revenues surged 8.8% to $330.3 million while Diagnostic Systems sales climbed 10.4% to $301 million.Global sales from the BD Biosciences unit rose 9.3% (or 4.3% in constant currency) year over year to $338 million. The performance of this segment was hurt by delays in government sponsored research in Western Europe. Growth was driven by higher Cell Analysis instrument and reagent sales.Weakness in core consumables hurt sales of Discovery Labware. Cell Analysis revenues climbed 10.7% to $255 million while Discovery Labware sales rose 5.3% year over year to $82.9 million.Loading...Loading...Margins and ExpensesGross margin edged up to 52.7% in the reported quarter from about 51.7% a year ago while operating margin rose slightly to 23.4% from 23.1% in the prior-year quarter. Consolidated operating costs and expenses increased 9.5% year over year to $1,542.4 million as the company spent more on both R&D (up 7.1%) and selling and administrative (up 14%) expenses.OutlookBased on the anticipated favorable foreign exchange impact, Becton Dickinson has hiked its revenue and earnings forecasts for fiscal 2011. The company now expects sales for the year to grow at the higher end of its previously communicated range of 5% to 6% year over year.On a currency neutral basis, sales are expected to increase at about 3% (versus 3.5% earlier) on account of lower sales in Western Europe.Moreover, the company has raised its earnings per share (on a reported basis) from continuing operations target to a new range of $5.65 to $5.70 from its prior view of $5.55 to $5.65, reflecting about 15% to 16% year-over-year growth.Earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 are expected to be 14% to 15% higher than adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.94 in fiscal 2010.Becton recently announced a definitive deal to buy Sweden-based Carmel Pharma, the maker of PhaSeal System, which is the leading closed system drug transfer device for handling hazardous medications. The deal is expected to close before the end of this fiscal year.We remain cautious about Becton Dickinson due to the lack of major short-term catalysts. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is already largely penetrated. On the positive side, Becton Dickinson'spreeminent global healthcare products franchise is partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the healthcare delivery field.Further, Becton Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors, includingBaxter International(BAX) in certain niches, in each of its three business segments.

Product sales remained flat year over year at $132.9 million as healthy growth in clinical diagnostic revenues was masked by softness across the blood screening and research products and services franchises.Clinical diagnostic sales zoomed 18% year over year to $87.5 million, boosted by higher sales of APTIMA Combo 2 assay and GTI Diagnostics acquisition. Moreover, foreign exchange movements contributed roughly $1.3 million to the top line.Blood screening product sales tumbled 22% year over year to $43.2 million, hit by lower shipment of assays and instruments (including the TIGRIS systems) to the company's partnerNovartis(NVS), unfavorable foreign exchange movements and supply-chain fluctuations. Assay and instrument shipments to Novartis fell $6 million and $5 million, respectively, in the quarter.Revenues from research products and services slid 28% year over year to $2.3 million, due to sustained weakness in pharmaceutical outsourcing.Collaborative research sales skid 61% year over year to $1.6 million, hurt by lower funding from Novartis for the development of the fully automated PANTHER instrument (for blood screening). Royalty and license revenues clipped 22% to $1.4 million.Margins & ExpensesGross margin on product sales improved to 70.3% from 66.6% a year-ago, supported by favorable sales mix (higher APTIMA sales) and foreign exchange tailwind. Total operating expenses rose 1.6% year over year to $106.1 million. Research and development expenses rose 2% year over year to $27.7 million.Marketing and sales expenses jumped 11% to $17.5 million due to sales force expansion in Europe and addition of GTI Diagnostics. General and administrative expenses surged 25% to $18.7 million as a resultof  the GTI Diagnostics acquisition and higher legal expenses primarily associated with the patent infringement case withBecton Dickinson(BDX).Loading...Loading...Balance Sheet and Cash FlowsGen-Probe exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $529.4 million, up 11.5% year over year, and short-term debt of $248 million (up 3% year over year). The company generated $45.4 million in cash flows from operations during the quarter and invested $12.5 million in capital expenditure, resulting in a free cash flow of $32.9 million.Guidance and RecommendationBased on its year-to-date results and outlook for the rest of the year, Gen-Probe has narrowed the top end of its revenues and earnings forecasts for fiscal 2011. The company now envisions revenues in the range of $575 million to $590 million versus its earlier forecast of $570 million to $595 million.Adjusted earnings per share forecast for the year have been trimmed to a band of $2.28 to $2.37 from the prior guidance of $2.28 to $2.40 to reflect increased share count and stock-based compensation expense. The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for 2011 revenue and earnings are $580 million and $2.32, respectively.Gen-Probe still expects adjusted operating margin between 27% and 29%. Product gross margin target has been revised to between 69% and 70% from 68% and 69.5%.Gen-Probe is a dominant player in the rapidly expanding nucleic acid test (“NAT”) market, the fastest growing segment of the clinical diagnostic market.  It is a market leader in domestic gonorrhea and chlamydia testing with its PACE and APTIMA assay product lines.Gen-Probe has a strong pipeline of novel assay products that are expected to be the harbinger of future growth. The company expects revenue growth in the second half to be driven by its APTIMA women's health business. Moreover, Gen-Probe's fully-automated molecular testing platform PANTHER will significantly contribute to its revenue growth in the years ahead as it broadens the testing menu for the instrument.However, Gen-Probe competes with more established firms such asRoche(RHHBY), Becton Dickinson, andAbbott Labs(ABT) in the maturing molecular diagnostic industry.

Adjusted earnings exclude one-time items such as restructuring charges and tax-related adjustments.Net income (from continuing operation) ballooned 51% year over year to $532 million (or $1.06 a share), powered by a sharp decrease in tax and solid growth at the Ireland-based company's Medical Devices business.Net sales jumped 14% year over year to $2,926 million, also topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,862 million. Healthy double-digit growth in the Medical Devices segment more than neutralized the sustained weakness at the Pharmaceuticals division and a still choppy procedure volume environment given patient deferrals due to high unemployment. Foreign exchange swings contributed roughly 5% to the growth.Revenues in the U.S. and international markets surged 12% and 17%, respectively, to $1,580 million and $1,346 million, respectively. While the results in Europe were healthy, the company faces some pricing pressure there stemming from the austerity measures. The forecast-topping results pushed up Covidien's shares roughly 5.7% in regular trading on July 26.Segment ReviewMedical Devices sales cruised 22% year over year to $1.99 billion led by Vascular and Energy Devices product-lines with acquisitions, new products and higher volume contributing to the growth.Within medical devices, Endomechanical Instruments revenues climbed 11% to $593 million, boosted by healthy growth in stapling products (including Tri-Staple). Energy Devices revenues soared 19% to $301 million on the heels of solid growth in vessel sealing sales. Soft Tissue Repair products sales jumped 10% to $229 million. Growth in suture business was partly offset by lower mesh and biosurgery sales.Oximetry and Monitoring revenues surged 12% to $211 million, driven by strong sales of sensors and monitors, backed by Aspect Medical and Somanetics acquisitions. Airway and Ventilation products sales edged up 3% to $183 million with divestiture of the sleep therapy product line and lower ventilator sales impacting growth. Revenues from the Vascular business more than doubled to $368 million, buoyed by eV3 acquisition.Covidien's struggling Pharmaceuticals division had yet another weak quarter, with revenues edging down 1% to $500 million, hit by the divestiture of the U.S. nuclear pharmacy business and lower sales of specialty drugs (down 6% to $120 million).Within Specialty Pharmaceuticals, generic product sales increased at a double-digit clip riding on the launch of the fentanyl patch and stabilization in generic pricing.Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients revenues rose 4% to $107 million, helped by higher acetaminophen sales. Contrast Products sales grew 5% to $157 million, supported by favorable foreign exchange translation.Revenues from Covidien's Medical Supplies segment inched up 3% to $441 million on the back of higher medical surgical and nursing care product sales.Margin & ExpensesGross margin increased to 57.1% from 55.6% a year-ago, attributable to favorable mix, synergies from restructuring programs and favorable foreign exchange movements, partly mitigated by higher raw material prices.Adjusted operating margin fell narrowly to 22.1% from 22.2% a year ago. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales rose to 4.7% from 4.3% a year ago. Selling, general and administrative expenses (as a percentage of sales) increased to 30.3% from 29.4%, partly due to new product launches.The company saw a marked decrease in the effective tax rate, which was 4.7% compared with 31.3% a year-ago, resulting from a favorable settlement with overseas tax authorities. On an adjusted basis, tax rate was 16.8% versus 20.5% a year-ago.Cash Flows & Shareholder ReturnsCovidien generated free cash flows of around $575 million in the third quarter. The company bought back roughly 4.9 million shares in the quarter under its existing repurchase program for $276 million. Covidien has returned more than $1 billion to its shareholders over the past twelve months, representing over 50% of its free cash flows, well above its target of 25%-40%.Loading...Loading...Restructuring ProgramDuring its third quarter commentary Covidien announced a restructuring program across its three business segments, aimed at boosting its cost structure. The move is expected cost the company roughly $275 million (pre-tax), most ofwhich is likely to be incurred by end of fiscal 2014.Covidien expects $175-$225 million in annual savings from the effort.OutlookCovidien has not updated its fiscal 2011 guidance, issued in the last quarter. The company expects net sales for the year to grow 8% to 11% year over year. Adjusted operating margin target for the year is 21.5%-22.5% while free cash flows are expected to be at least $1.7 billion. The company's year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate of 18.3% is consistent with its fiscal 2011 guidance of 18.5%-19.5%.Covidien is a leading global healthcare products company that develops and markets medical solutions for better patient outcomes. The company's core medical devices business faces stiff competition fromJohnson & Johnson(JNJ),Becton Dickinson(BDX) andC.R. Bard(BCR).Covidien remains committed to rolling out new products and technologies, focusing on growth markets, and boosting market share in core segments through investments in sales and marketing infrastructure.Moreover, the company is expanding its portfolio through acquisitions and strategic collaborations.

The results exceeded Baxter's earlier guidance of $1.01 to $1.03.Baxter reported a profit of $615 million (or $1.07 a share) in the quarter versus $535 million (or 90 cents a share) a year ago.RevenuesTotal revenues were $3,536 million in the second quarter, up 11% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,378 million. U.S. revenues for the quarter jumped 5% to $1,418 million while ex-U.S. sales were higher 15% (up 7% in constant currency) to $2,118 million.Segment-wise Revenue AnalysisOn a segment basis, Bioscience sales totaled $1,553 million, up 14% (up 10% in constant currency) year over year. The improved performance was attributable to higher demand for Gammagard Liquid (Immune Globulin Intravenous – Human, marketed as Kiovig ex-U.S.), several specialty plasma-based therapeutics and vaccines.The biggest sub-segment, Recombinants, had revenues of $570 million, up 9% in reported terms (up 3% in constant currency) year over year. The Plasma Proteins business, where Baxter faced structural issues in the past, performed well with revenues of $363 million, up 16% (up 11% in constant currency) year over year. Antibody Therapy produced strong results with sales of $381 million, climbing 23% (up 21% in constant currency) year over year.Sales of Medical Products went up by 8% year over year (up 3% in constant currency), to $1,973 million. During the reported quarter, Baxter concluded the divestment of its domestic multi-source generic injectables business to Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC. Excluding the divested business from both years, segment sales increased 10% (5% in constant currency) benefiting from robust growth in anesthesia products, nutritional therapies, infusion systems and other injectable drugs.Three prominent sub-segments were Renal with revenues of $633 million, up 2% in constant currency; IV Therapies with sales of $452 million, up 3% in constant currency; and Global Injectables with revenues of $506 million, up 3% in constant currency.Loading...Loading...MarginsGross margin was 51.9% in the second quarter, up from 51.3% in the year-ago quarter. Marketing and administrative expense, as a percentage of sales, was down 100 basis points to 21.6% while research and development expense retreated to 6.8% from 6.9% in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents totaled $2,018 million, as of June 30, 2011, down 12.3% year over year. Net debt totaled $2,382 million, down 5.3% year over year.Outlook and RecommendationBaxter issued its guidance for third-quarter fiscal 2011 and raised its earnings estimates for 2011. For the third quarter, the company expects growth in revenues in the range of 3% to 4% in constant currency and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.07 to $1.09.For fiscal 2011, Baxter still anticipates growth in revenues in the range of 3% to 4% in constant currency and raised expectations for adjusted earnings per share to a band of $4.27 and $4.32 (earlier $4.20 and $4.28). In addition, the company forecasts cash flow from operations of about $2.8 billion. The current Zacks Consensus Estimates are $1.07 and $4.26 per share for the third quarter and fiscal 2011, respectively.The news regarding Baxter still remains mixed. On the positive side, Baxter's focus on life-sustaining products, which are not commoditized, partly insulates it from an economic downturn. The company is able to generate recurring revenues, and consistent cash flow, due to its focus on chronic diseases.On the flip side, despite recent improvement in Plasma Proteins and Antibody Therapy sub-segments, we are concerned about stagnation in sales, a slightly somber outlook for some hospital spending and tightening of reimbursement.Improved execution has lifted sentiment somewhat toward Baxter. Baxter is a good bet for value investors willing to wait as fundamentals improve further. Among others, it competes withBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) in certain niches.

The victim faces difficulty performing simple tasks. If left untreated, MMN may degenerate into muscle atrophy or involuntary twitching.The favorable opinion for Kiovig MMN is underpinned by a couple of open-label, investigator-initiated prospective clinical efficacy studies on victims of MMN, both of which demonstrated upkeep of muscular strength and better functionality. Negative events were transient in nature and in line with those seen with other Kiovig indications.Earlier, Baxter launched a phase 3 trial, in 2008, in Canada and the U.S., for Gammagard Liquid (known as Kiovig overseas) for the treatment of MMN. Following its conclusion later this year, Baxter plans to obtain Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval. The company has received Orphan Drug Designation for this indication in the U.S.Kiovig originally received approval, in Europe, in 2006 and the drug has been obtainable in the U.S. since 2005. It is sold as Gammagard Liquid - Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human).

Although a number of these issues are expected to linger through the remainder of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling healthcare costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.Increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from the healthcare reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical device companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – More Stringent RegulationThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator has shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies.President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine, which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.The FDA plans to implement its new set of plans through a process of regulatory actions such as draft guidance and proposed regulations, which will be open to public feedback. CDRH stated that it will wait for the pending review report of the Institute of Medicine before making a final decision.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.Loading...Loading...OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro, radiation oncology and blood-related products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD),Varian Medical(VAR) andHaemonetics Corporation(HAE).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space in the wake of recovery.In addition, low global penetration and robust demand provides a positive long-term thesis for investing in the blood processing industry. Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a slew of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed slower market growth of ICD in the U.S. in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.We believe that the recently approved REVO MRI SureScan pacemaker and Arctic Front catheter should provide some support to Medtronic's CRM business. REVO is already gaining positive initial market acceptance and is expected to be key growth drivers going ahead. The company's struggling spinal franchise should also benefit gradually from the recent product launches.Moreover, Medtronic plans to adopt restructuring initiatives (including workforce reduction) to sustain long-term growth. The company is also blessed with strong cash flows which it prudently uses for maximizing shareholder value. Medtronic is active on the acquisition front and is investing in emerging markets, which it considers an increasingly important growth driver.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership position in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market with 46% share in the U.S. market. The launch of Taxus Element stent (commercialized as Ion) in the U.S. in April 2011 strongly places the company to gain DES share. Moreover, its pipeline DES product Promus Element (expected launch in the U.S. in mid-2012) is shaping up to be a major driver of its stent business. Besides, the acquisition of asthma-treatment company Asthmatx has enabled Boston Scientic to target the pulmonary devices area.Boston Scientific has undertaken a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives that are expected to contribute to the bottom line moving forward. The company plans to expand its footprint in the emerging markets by reinvesting the savings from restructuring efforts. In this context, we reckon the company's divestiture of its Neurovascular business as a smart move, enabling it to prepay a portion of the debt and invest in high growth markets.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify lines of ICDs are already gaining notable traction. Moreover, launch of several products (including the quadripolar CRT systems) should boost the company's CRM market share in 2011.The recent European clearance of the Accent MRI pacemaker and the approval ShockGuard technology, designed for use with the Fortify and Unify systems, represents an incremental positive for the company. Another encouraging prospect is St. Jude's April 2011 pact with health care supply contracting company Novation. Under the deal, Novation will make the company's CRM products available to some of the leading academic centers in the U.S. This should broaden the use of St. Jude's products and technologies and boost its market share.Moreover, the recent U.S. approval of two new irrigated ablation catheters (Safire BLU and Therapy Cool Path) for treating cardiac arrhythmias should help St. Jude sustain the healthy growth in Atrial Fibrillation through 2011.Trifecta, which was launched in Europe in fourth-quarter 2010 and was recently approved in the U.S., represents a major new driver for the company's Cardiovascular franchise. St. Jude's tissue valve business in Europe is growing more than 30% rate and the company expects similar growth in the U.S.We are also optimistic about the emerging opportunity in the intravascular imaging market, enabled by the company's LightLab acquisition in July 2010. Moreover, its $1.3 billion acquisition of heart devices maker AGA Medical Holdings will eventually make St. Jude a clear leader in the structural heart market. The company expects the acquisition to help its sales grow at a low double-digit rate in 2011.However, we do acknowledge the fact that a soft CRM market may be a drag on these stocks. The prevailing macroeconomic factors, pricing pressure, austerity measures and the impact of health care reform are expected to continue to weigh on the CRM market through 2011. Data for the U.S. defibrillators market, published in the first-quarter 2011, indicate deterioration in the defibrillator market growth rate, including the pricing impact.The CRM market also faces a number of challenges including physician reaction to recent study results published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (“JAMA”) regarding evidence-based guidelines for ICD implants and the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation into hospitals' ICD implants.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the first quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Moreover, Edwards's strong balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Importantly, its Sapien transcatheter heart valve is slated for review by the FDA Advisory Panel on July 20, 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth. Based on an upbeat Impella outlook, Abiomed recently issued a solid revenue guidance.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its coveted RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude recently registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for the incumbent players such as Volcano Corp. (VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for the MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession. However, first quarter results indicate continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. This may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESJapan Debacle: Greater Impact Looms?The impact of the March 11 earthquake (and Tsunami) in Japan and its aftermath on the medical devices industry appears to be substantial. Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region.The roughly $25 billion Japanese medical devices sector has been an extremely successful market for American medical devices firms. U.S. firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.MedTech majors such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific andJohnson & Johnson's(JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.The impact of the horrific disaster is being already felt as it has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products. The negative impact of the Japan crisis on MedTech companies with high exposure is expected to become more pronounced in the June quarter.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis (as reflected in falling share prices), which is hard to gauge at this moment.Softness in Orthopedic LingersWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). While most of these names beat expectations in the first quarter we remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes Here to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine: Still HurtsThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their March quarter results.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market over the next few quarters. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilized but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe . The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Both these companies reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter. A general sluggishness in procedure volume continues to impinge on the results of the leading players in the orthopedic market.March quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although manifesting some signs of sequential stabilization) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCONMED CORP (CNMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportHAEMONETICS CP (HAE): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportSPRINT NEXTEL (S): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportWRIGHT MEDICAL (WMGI): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

Although a number of these issues are expected to linger through the remainder of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling healthcare costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.Increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from the healthcare reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical device companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – More Stringent RegulationThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator has shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies.President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine, which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review.

These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude recently registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for the incumbent players such as Volcano Corp. (VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for the MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession. However, first quarter results indicate continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. This may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESJapan Debacle: Greater Impact Looms?The impact of the March 11 earthquake (and Tsunami) in Japan and its aftermath on the medical devices industry appears to be substantial. Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region.The roughly $25 billion Japanese medical devices sector has been an extremely successful market for American medical devices firms. U.S. firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.MedTech majors such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific andJohnson & Johnson's(JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.The impact of the horrific disaster is being already felt as it has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products. The negative impact of the Japan crisis on MedTech companies with high exposure is expected to become more pronounced in the June quarter.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis (as reflected in falling share prices), which is hard to gauge at this moment.Softness in Orthopedic LingersWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). While most of these names beat expectations in the first quarter we remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes Here to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine: Still HurtsThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their March quarter results.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market over the next few quarters. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilized but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe . The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Both these companies reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter. A general sluggishness in procedure volume continues to impinge on the results of the leading players in the orthopedic market.March quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although manifesting some signs of sequential stabilization) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCONMED CORP (CNMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportHAEMONETICS CP (HAE): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportSPRINT NEXTEL (S): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportWRIGHT MEDICAL (WMGI): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

HUS, which predominantly affects children, is a life-threatening condition which typically occurs when an infection in the digestive system produces toxic substances that destroy red blood cells, leading to kidney failure.STEC, the common foodborne contaminants, is the shiga toxins (shiga toxin 1 or shiga toxin 2) that the organisms produce, causing serious complications in the infected person. Studies reveal that shiga toxin 2 has a higher association with HUS. As such, rapid detection of toxin 2 type will allow physicians to immediately isolateand treat infected patients to lower the chances of HUS development.Europe has been plagued by the worst E. coli crisis in recent history. Already 37 people have reportedly succumbed to Germany's killer E. coli outbreak, the one of its kind ever recorded.There has been 1 confirmed and three suspected cases of E. coli O104:H4 infection in the U.S. Moreover, 1 HUS case in Massachusetts has been confirmed as similar to the German outbreak strain.Meridian conducted testing on one of these clinical samples using its two distinct tests for STEC (Premier EHEC and ImmunoCard STAT! EHEC) and confirmed that its tests have correctly identified the samples as shiga toxin 2 producing. The Premier EHEC and ImmunoCard STAT! EHEC tests detected both shiga toxin types. The ImmunoCard STAT! EHEC offers an added benefit as it differentiates between shiga toxin 1 and shiga toxin 2.Cincinnati-based Meridian specializes in developing diagnostic test kits for multiple serious and infectious diseases. Its diagnostics business faces strong competition fromAbbott Laboratories(ABT),Becton, Dickinson and Company(BDX),Thermo Fisher(TMO) andSiemens(SI).Meridian is expecting a rebound in 2011 from a beleaguered fiscal 2010 which was hit by a dreary influenza season, stiff competition in itsC. difficilediagnostic business and a soft economy.The company hopes sales in fiscal 2011 to be boosted by its diagnostic test kits for detecting bacteria likeC. difficileandH. pylori. Moreover, theillumigenemolecular test platform, which represents Meridian's response to growing competition, is expected to be its principal growth engine in the coming years.Loading...Loading...ABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportSIEMENS AG-ADR (SI): Free Stock Analysis ReportTHERMO FISHER (TMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportMERIDIAN BIOSCI (VIVO): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

The company manufactures and sells a wide range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products.As a healthcare company, revenue and earnings shouldn't fluctuate much with the overall company. That's good news if another recession is right around the corner.In fact, management recently increased its EPS guidance for 2011 following solid second quarter results. Analysts are currently projecting 15% EPS growth in 2011 and 11% growth in 2012.In addition, the company generates strong free cash flow and has been consistently raising its dividend over the last decade. It currently yields 1.9%.Second Quarter ResultsBecton, Dickinson and Company reported stellar second quarter results in late April. Earnings per share came in at $1.38, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30. It was a 13% increase over the same quarter in 2010.Revenue rose 7% to $1.922 billion, well ahead of the $1.855 billion consensus. The BD Medical segment, which accounted for 51% of total revenue, rose 7% due in part to strong sales of Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems products.The BD Diagnostics segment, which made up 31% of total revenue, increased 9% due in part to solid growth in the Preanalytical Systems safety-engineered products and in Diagnostic Systems infectious disease platforms.Geographically, revenues were strongest outside the U.S. as sales rose 9%, reflecting continued strength in the emerging markets. Approximately 57% of sales came from overseas. Revenues in the U.S. were up 5%.Overall, operating income was up 6% year-over-year as a 19% increase in R&D expenses offset a slightly improved gross margin.OutlookManagement raised its EPS guidance for 2011 following solid second quarter results. The company now expects to earn between $5.55 and $5.65 per share, up from previous guidance of $5.45 to $5.55.This prompted analysts to revise their estimates higher for both 2011 and 2012. The 2011 Zacks Consensus Estimate is $5.62, 15% higher than 2010 EPS. The 2012 consensus estimate is currently $6.21, corresponding to 11% EPS growth.It is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock.DividendBecton, Dickinson and Company has a solid history of steadily raising its dividend:Loading...Loading...It currently yields 1.9%.The company's payout ratio is just 31%, leaving plenty of room for more double-digit dividend hikes in the near future.ValuationValuation looks very reasonable with shares trading at 15.1x forward earnings, a discount to the industry average of 19.9x.Its price to sales ratio is 2.5, in-line with its peers.BDX has relatively fat margins and consistently generates strong returns on equity. ROE over the last 12 months was a solid 23.8%, compared with just 7.6% for the industry.The company is headquartered in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey and has a market cap of $18.6 billion.ConclusionBecton, Dickinson and Company should continue to see solid growth over the next few years regardless of what the overall economy is doing. That should provide much needed stability to a portfolio if the U.S. is headed towards another recession.With strong growth projections, a rapidly rising dividend and reasonable valuation, the stock looks like an attractive buy for the long-term investor.Todd Bunton is the Growth & Income Stock Strategist forZacks.com.BECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

The clinical trial is expected to start sometime in the fourth quarter of 2011 or the subsequent quarter.Based on an understanding with the pharma company, Unilife delivered its first batch of devices, in April 2011, for clinical evaluation. The terms of the understanding have not been disclosed yet. The company expects to shortly conclude the agreement for follow-on clinical supply to finally develop clinical devices and deliver them for upcoming clinical trials.According to Unilife, targeted organ delivery is one of its key technology platforms. Its initial phase of agreement with this large pharma company heralds its growth in value-added segments of advanced drug delivery mechanisms.Unilife believes that it can win such deals due to its successful commercialization of the Unifill syringe. It now plans to repeat the Unifill success story on a larger scale by developing a large portfolio of new pipeline devices. Each of these upcoming products holds the promise of revolutionizing the delivery of therapeutic drugs.Unilife recently reported third quarter (ended March 31) fiscal 2011 results. The company missed both earnings and revenue estimates. Adjusted (excluding one-time expenses other than stock-based compensation) loss per share of 20 cents was higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the year-ago loss per share. Revenue was a nominal $0.7 million in the quarter, down 70.8% year over year, and was also lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Unilife is a medical devices company that designs, manufactures and sells advanced drug delivery systems. It collaborates with biotech and pharma companies and searchesfor new devices that could be used with their drugs.The company has developed a wide array of its own injectable drug delivery products, including retractable syringes. It sells its prefilled syringes to pharma manufacturers, suppliers of medical products to healthcare facilities and patients who self-administer prescription drugs. Unilife's patented syringes provide integrated safety, which is designed to protect patients from needle stick injuries.

Firstly, it wanted to provide researchers with one system which would tackle both mundane applications and complicated multi-color experiments. Secondly, the company wanted to simplify workflow and design an easy-to-use system with internal intelligence. Finally, Becton desired to preserve clients' investments by providing an upgrade mechanism for 10 parameters (versus 6 earlier) besides numerous optional features.Researchers can utilize the BD FACSuite Software System designed for the BD FACSVerse Flow Cytometer to automate normal tasks, such as instrument startup, setup and data analysis, as well as accomplish others with as few clicks as possible.The software's modular design allows users to multi-task, thereby permitting data analysis while, at the same time, the system is gathering data. BD FACSuite Software allows experiments and assays to be transferred to BD FACSVerse Systems based in other locations, thereby reducing frequently seen systemic and user-related divergences.The BD FACSVerse Flow Cytometer comes with its own intelligence that is designed to increase efficiency, cut down mistakes, automate processes and reduce interaction with users. For example, it has a vacuum-based fluidic component, which permits flexibility when introducing samples.The BD FACSVerse Flow Cytometer can now be obtained in different color configurations, such as 4-color, 6-color and 8-color setups, with forward-scatter and side-scatter support for as many as 10 parameters. The 4 and 6-color setups are expandable with upgrades. The system comes in a compact size which allows it to easily fit into standard lab bench tops.We remain cautious about Becton Dickinson due to a lack of major short-term catalysts. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is already largely penetrated.On the positive side, Becton Dickinson's preeminent global healthcare products franchise is partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the healthcare delivery field.Becton Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors, includingBaxter International(BAX) in certain niches, in each of its three business segments.

Net income for the quarter increased 4.8% year over year to about $312 million on the back of higher revenues across the board.The Results in BriefBecton Dickinson recorded revenues of $1,922 million in the reported quarter, up 6.8% (or 4.6% in constant currency) year over year, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,856 million.Domestic sales for the quarter were $829 million, up 4.7% year over year. Ex-U.S. revenues were $1,093 million, up 8.5%.

A similar trend was seen for fiscal 2012 with 16 analysts (out of 18) raised their forecast over the last 30 days (including 1 over the past 7 days) with no downward revision.We believe that the positive revisions are an outcome of the forecast-shattering second quarter results coupled with the company's upward guidance revision for fiscal 2011.Loading...Loading...Magnitude – Consensus Estimate TrendUniform upward directional movement has led to an increase in annual forecast for Becton Dickinson.

Revenues and earnings for first-quarter fiscal 2011 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates, buoyed by healthy growth in the company's clinical diagnostic business. However, profit dipped year over year as revenue growth was masked by higher costs.Product revenues rose 6% on the back of higher sales from clinical diagnostic products. However, the company's blood screening business (sales down 6%) remained lumpy, hit by lower sales of TIGRIS systems to partnerNovartis(NVS). The California-based company backed its financial guidance for fiscal 2011.Gen-Probe is a dominant player in the rapidly expanding NAT market, the fastest growing segment of the clinical diagnostic market. It is a market leader in domestic gonorrhea and chlamydia testing with its PACE and APTIMA assay product lines.We believe Gen-Probe is well placed with a slew of new products that are expected to drive growth in the years ahead. Moreover, the ongoing market shift away from traditional diagnostic methods towards molecular testing represents a tailwind for the company.The company's acquisition of specialty diagnostics firm GTI Diagnostics in late 2010 represents a positive step, providing a boost to its top line. Higher sales of GTI Diagnostics products catalyzed double-digit growth in the clinical diagnostic business in the first quarter.Moreover, the company boasts a reasonably sound balance sheet and is making prudent use of healthy free cash flows by means of acquisitions and overseas expansion initiatives as well as rewarding shareholders through share repurchases.However, Gen-Probe competes with more established firms such asRoche(RHHBY),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andAbbott Labs(ABT) in the maturing molecular diagnostic industry. Moreover, the company's clinical diagnostics products are susceptible to reimbursement risk and its international sales are subject to foreign exchange swings.Gen-Probe's struggling blood screening franchise may remain under pressure due to a soft market condition and fewer TIGRIS systems sold to Novartis. While new product development and international expansions are vital for sustaining future growth, associated high expenses (R&D investment and sales/marketing expenses) may weigh on the company's bottom line moving forward.

For the second quarter, the company expects growth in revenues in the range of 4% to 5% in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.01 to $1.03.Baxter anticipates growth in revenues in the range of 3% to 4% (earlier 2% to 3%), in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share of about $4.20 to $4.28 (earlier $4.15 to $4.25) for fiscal 2011.The news regarding Baxter remains somewhat mixed. On the positive side, Baxter's focus on life-sustaining products, which are not commoditized, partly insulates it from an economic downturn. The company is able to generate recurring revenues, and consistent cash flow, due to its focus on chronic diseases.On the flip side, despite recent improvement in Plasma Proteins and Antibody Therapy sub-segments, we are concerned about stagnation in sales, a still somber outlook for some hospital spending and tightening of reimbursement.Improved execution has improved sentiment toward Baxter. The company remains a good bet for value investors willing to wait as fundamentals improve. Among others, it competes withBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) andTalecris Biotherapeutics Holdings Corp.(TLCR) in certain niches.

Shares of New Jersey-based Becton Dickinson gained $1.26 to reach $86.15 in after-hours trading, following  better-than-expected results and its upward revision of guidance.RevenuesBecton Dickinson posted revenues of $1,922 million, up 6.8% (or 4.6% in constant currency) year over year, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,856 million.Geographically, domestic sales rose 4.7% year over year to $829 million while ex-U.S. sales jumped 8.5% to $1,093 million. International sales were driven by sustained healthy growth in emerging markets, partly ebbed by the slowdown in Western European markets due to a soft economy.Segment ReviewIn BD Medical, Becton's largest division, global revenues climbed 6.5% (or 4.9% in constant currency) year over year to $981 million, led by healthy revenues from Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems products. The results also reflect an unfavorable year over year comparison of roughly 1.6% due to sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic in fiscal 2010.Within BD Medical, revenues from Medical Surgical Systems rose 4.8% year over year to $504.6 million. Diabetes Care sales cruised 10.5% to $207.8 million while Pharmaceutical Systems revenues soared 6.6% to $269 million.In BD Diagnostics, global sales spiked 8.9% (or 6.5% in constant currency) year over year to $605.3 million, boosted by healthy revenues from Preanalytical Systems' safety-engineered products and solid Diagnostic Systems sales. Preanalytical Systems revenues surged 6.5% to $306.2 million while Diagnostic Systems sales climbed 11.6% to $299.1 million.Global sales from the BD Biosciences unit rose 4.1% (or 0.4% in constant currency) year over year to $335.3 million. While growthwas driven by higher cell analysis instrument and reagent sales, the results were negatively impacted by unfavorable comparisonand the impact of  the earthquake in Japan. Cell Analysis revenues climbed 5.4% to $255.5 million while Discovery Labware sales were essentially flat year over year at $79.8 million.Margins and ExpensesGross margin edged up to 52.1% in the reported quarter from roughly 52% a year-ago while operating margin fell narrowly to 22.9% from 23% in the prior-year quarter. Consolidated operating costs and expenses climbed 6.9% year over year to $1,481.7 million as the company spent more on both R&D (up 18.9%) and selling and administrative (up 5%) expenses.Loading...Loading...Accuri AcquisitionBecton announced, in February 2011, a definitive agreement to acquire Accuri Cytometers, a Michigan-based company, which makes personal flow cytometers for use by researchers. The acquisition, which is synergistic with Becton's strategy for its Cell Analysis sub-segment, was consummated in March 2011.JapanImpactBecton like many other top-tier medical technology companies was impacted by the massive temblor (and subsequent Tsunami) in Japan and its aftermath. Its manufacturing facility in Fukushima sustained some damage following the debacle, however, some manufacturing lines were restarted recently.The company stated that order volumes for its products in Japan have returned to normal levels and expects manufacturing of its Hypak prefillable syringes to resume in third-quarter fiscal 2011. The unfavorable impact of the Japan quake onits second quarter sales was less than $10 million. Becton expects an aggregate negative impact of $10-$20 million on its revenues for fiscal 2011, which has been factored into its full-year guidance.Outlook RaisedBased on the anticipated favorable foreign exchange impact, Becton Dickinson has hiked its revenue and earnings forecasts for fiscal 2011. The company now expects sales for the year to grow roughly 5%-6% year over year versus its earlier projected growth of 4%.Moreover, the company has raised its earnings per share (on a reported basis) from continuing operations target to a new range of $5.55 to $5.65 from its prior view of $5.45 to $5.55, reflecting a roughly 13%-15% year over year growth. The revised forecast, however, incorporates the unfavorable impact of the Japan disaster and higher resin costs. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2011 is $5.54.We remain cautious about Becton Dickinson due to the lack of major short-term catalysts. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is already largely penetrated.Further, Becton Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors, includingBaxter International(BAX), in each of its three business segments. We currently have a long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock, backed by a short-term Zacks #3 Rank (Hold).BAXTER INTL (BAX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

Adjusted earnings exclude one-time items such as inventory and restructuring charges.Net income (from continuing operation) shot up 9% year over year to $459 million (or 92 cents a share) buoyed by higher sales from the Ireland-based company's Medical Devices (notably vascular) business.Net sales climbed 10% yearover year to $2,801 million, also exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,747 million. Double-digit growth in the Medical Devices business was partly ebbed by the sustained decline at the Pharmaceuticals division.Segment AnalysisRevenues from Medical Devices spiked 16% year over year to $1.88 billion on the heels of healthy growth across Vascular and Energy Devices product-lines, backed by acquisitions and new products. While hospital admissions remained choppy, volume for select procedures improved in the quarter.Within medical devices, Endomechanical Instruments sales rose 7% to $557 million, boosted by double-digit growth in stapling products (including Tri-Staple). Revenues from the Vascular business zoomed 103%, buoyed by the eV3acquisition.Energy Devices sales surged 17% to $283 million riding on solid vessel sealing sales. Revenues from Soft Tissue Repair products increased 3% to $220 million as growth in the suture business was partly offset by lower biosurgery sales.Oximetry and Monitoring revenues (up 9% to $211 million) were boosted by higher sales of sensors and monitors, aidedby the acquisition of monitoring equipment makers Aspect Medical and Somanetics. Airway and Ventilation products sales slipped 7% to $185 million, partly due to the divestiture of the sleep therapy product line and lower ventilator sales.Sales from Covidien's struggling Pharmaceuticals division, which remains engulfed in aggressive price competition, clipped 4% to $490 million. The decline is attributable to the divestiture of the U.S. nuclearpharmacybusiness. However, the results were in line with the company's expectations.Within Pharmaceuticals, revenues from Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients rose 8% to $121 million on the back of higher acetaminophen sales. Contrast Products sales rose 5% to $154 million, supported by strong international growth. Specialty Pharmaceuticals sales edged up 1% to $106 million. Within this category, generic product sales increased modestly, helped by stabilization in pricing and launch of the fentanyl patch.Revenues from the company's Medical Supplies segment rose 3% to $434 million attributable to higher revenues of medical surgical and nursing care product lines.Margin TrendGross margin remained stable year over year at 57%. On an adjusted basis, gross margin improved modestly to 57.3% as favorable business mix, portfolio realignment and synergies from restructuring efforts were partly marred by unfavorable foreign exchange movements. Adjusted operating margin rose to 22.2% from 22.4% a year ago.Guidance RaisedBased on its healthy performance during first-half fiscal 2011 and favorable foreign exchange rates, Covidien has raised its revenue, operating margin and cash flow guidance for fiscal 2011. The company now envisions net sales for the year to grow 8% to 11% year over year versus its prior forecast of 6% to 9%.Medical Devices sales are forecasted to grow 13% to 16% year over year, an increase of 300 basis points fromthe previous guidance. Pharmaceuticals sales are expected to be down 3% to flat while Medical Supplies revenues are projected to be flat to up 3%.Adjusted operating margin for the year now has been projected in the range of 21.5% to 22.5%, up fromthe earlier projection of 21% to 22%. Free cash flow is now forecasted to be at least $1.7billion versus prior guidance of $1.6 billion.Loading...Loading...The company has revised its estimated effective tax rate, which is now expected be between 18.5% to 19.5% vis-à-vis the earlier forecast of 18.4% or less. The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for 2011 revenues and EPS are $11,269 million and $3.78, respectively.Covidien is a leading global healthcare products company that develops and markets medical solutions for better patient outcomes. The company's core medical devices business faces stiff competition fromJohnson & Johnson(JNJ),Becton Dickinson(BDX) andC.R. Bard(BCR).The acquisition of ev3 has pushed the company's leadership up in the endovascular devices market giving it a strong foothold in both the peripheral vascular and neurovascular sub-segments.Covidien remains committed to rolling out new products and technologies, focusing on fast-growing markets, and boosting market share in core segments through investments in sales and marketing infrastructure. Moreover, the divestiture of its specialty chemicals and sleep therapy product line has enabled the company to rationalize its product portfolio and reallocate resources to faster-growing, higher-margin businesses.BARD C R INC (BCR): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCOVIDIEN PLC (COV): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is $1.30, representing an estimated year-over-year increase of 4.74%.During an earlier announcement, the company had guided both reported and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 to grow about 10% to 12% to a range of $5.45 to $5.55. At the same time, Becton, Dickinson added that it expects fiscal 2011 revenues to increase about 4% year over year.First-Quarter RecapBecton, Dickinson reported first-quarter fiscal 2011 earnings of $1.35 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29. Total revenues decreased 1.4% year over year (1.5% in constant currency) to $1.84 billion and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 billion.Domestic sales for the quarter amounted to $829 million, down 2.9% year over year, including a negative impact of 6% from the flu pandemic in the preceding year. Overseas revenues were $1.01 billion, down 0.2% (or 0.3% in constant currency), including a negative impact of 3% from the flu pandemic. Becton, Dickinson experienced higher growth in emerging markets, offset by a slowdown in European markets.Estimate Revision TrendLoading...Loading...AgreementThe overall trend in estimate revisions for the upcoming quarter is relatively static. Of the 16 analysts covering the stock, there were no upward or downward revisions during the past 7 days. Only one analyst has raised his/her estimate in the past month while none lowered their forecast.With regard to fiscal 2011, only 1 analyst (out of 17) lifted his/her estimate over the last week with no reverse movements. Over the past month, three analysts raised their estimates while none moved in the opposite direction. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2011 is $5.51, reflecting an estimated 12.51% year-over-year growth.MagnitudeGiven the relative lack of estimate revisions, the magnitude of revisions for the forthcoming quarter and fiscal year has hit a plateau, for both the past 7 and 30 days.Becton, Dickinson has reported positive earnings surprises in three of the previous four quarters. The company produced an average positive earnings surprise of 1.97% over the prior four quarters, meaning that it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by that measure.Our Take on Becton, DickinsonBecton, Dickinson, a leading global medical technology company, produces and markets medical devices, instrument systems and reagents. The company is dedicated to enhancing drug delivery, improving the pace of diagnosing infectious diseases and cancer and advancing R&D for new drugs.We remain cautious about Becton, Dickinsondue to the lack of major short-term catalysts. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is already predominantly penetrated. Further, Becton, Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors in each of its three business segments.We are, however, hopeful that growth may recover in the future with the European Union adoption of safety requirements, recovery in research markets and continued growth in flow cytometry in the clinical setting. Becton, Dickinson'spreeminent global health care products franchise is partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the health care delivery field.The company competes, in niches, with different companies such asBaxter International(BAX) among others.

Its first quarter results in 2010 included after-tax special items aggregating $627 million (or $1.04 per share) arising from the Colleague infusion pump and a change in certain tax treatment.The forecast-topping results, coupled with the company's upward revisions to guidance, pushed up its shares $1.48 (2.71%) to $56 in early trading on April 21.RevenuesTotal revenues were $3,284 million in the first quarter, up 12% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,178 million. Revenues in the prior year included an adjustment of $213 million for the Colleague infusion pump. Excluding this adjustment, worldwide sales grew 5% year over year. Domestic revenues for the quarter jumped 10% to $1,422 million while overseas sales were higher 1% to $1,862 million.Segment-wise Revenue AnalysisWith regard to segment performance, Bioscience revenues totaled $1,408 million, up 3% (up 4% in constant currency) year over year. The better performance was attributable to higher demand for Gammagard Liquid, several specialty plasma-based therapeutics and biosurgery products.The largest sub-segment, Recombinants, had sales of $512 million, flat in reported terms (up 1% in constant currency) year over year. The Plasma Proteins business, where Baxter had encountered structural problems in the past, performed well with revenues of $308 million, up 5% (up 8% in constant currency) year over year.

For the second quarter, the company expects growth in revenues in the range of 4% to 5% in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.01 to $1.03.Baxter anticipates growth in revenues in the range of 3% to 4% (earlier 2% to 3%), in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share of about $4.20 to $4.28 (earlier $4.15 to $4.25) for fiscal 2011.

467,7957,Baxter Acquiring Prism Pharma - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/04/1017210/baxter-acquiring-prism-pharm,2011-04-19,BDX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Baxter International(BAX) recently announced that it has inked a definitive pact to purchase privately-held Prism Pharmaceuticals, a specialty pharma company located in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.Per the agreement terms, Baxter will pay up to $338 million, comprising an initial cash outflow of $170 million and as much as $168 million in forthcoming revenue-based milestone installments. Subject to regulatory approvals, the deal is expected to conclude in the second quarter of 2011. The transaction is not forecast to materially impact Baxter's fiscal 2011 results.Prism Pharmaceuticals developed and then obtained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) certification for numerous presentations of NEXTERONE (amiodarone HCl), which is an antiarrhythmic substance. The NEXTERONE product line does not contain benzyl alcohol and polysorbate 80. It contains the sole ready-to-be used premixed intravenous (IV) bag formulations, vials as well as pre-filled syringe.The NEXTERONE IV formulations, in a premixed condition, were recently authorized by the FDA in a couple of readily usable dosages: 150 mg in a 100 ml package for quick 10-minute loading infusion and 360 mg in a 200 ml package for future loading and upkeep infusion.These formulations do not need mixing, thereby obviating possible medication mistakes related to compounding. Furthermore, NEXTERONE can be kept at normal temperature for 2 years. The product fits in automated dispensing furniture, placing it within patient care arenas ready for usage during critical situations.Before its decision to acquire Prism Pharmaceuticals, Baxter was its contract manufacturer, on the basis of selection by Prism, to produce the premixed IV bags utilizing Baxter's own GALAXY container know how as well as pre-filled syringes.Amiodarone can be categorized as an antiarrhythmic medicine used for ventricular tachyarrhythmias or rapid types of irregular heartbeat. NEXTERONE Premixed Injection is used for starting treatment and prophylaxis of common ventricular fibrillation and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia. NEXTERONE has several significant contraindications as provided by the company.The news regarding Baxter remains mixed. On the positive side, Baxter's focus on life-sustaining products, which are not commoditized, partly insulates it from an economic downturn. The company is able to generate recurring revenues, and consistent cash flow, due to its focus on chronic diseases.On the flip side, despite recent improvement in Plasma Proteins and Antibody Therapy sub-segments, we are concerned about stagnation in sales, a slightly somber outlook for some hospital spending and tightening of reimbursement.The lingering neutrality surrounding the stock can be lifted by consistent execution. Baxter is a good bet for value investors willing to wait as fundamentals improve.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 93 cents, representing an estimated 0.20% annualized decline.Fourth Quarter RecapBaxter reported fourth quarter 2010 adjusted (excluding one-time items) earnings per share of $1.11, beating the corresponding Zacks Consensus Estimates of $1.10 and surpassing the year-ago result of $1.03.Reported net income dropped 26% year over year to $423 million (or 72 cents per share), mainly resulting from special after-tax charges of $227 million for asset impairment and costs related to Baxter's initiatives in the area of business optimization, higher reserves for litigation and in-process R&D expenses. Among the positive factors, Baxter retained a strong product pipeline with several products in late-stage clinical development.Revenues for the quarter were $3,498 million, up 1% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,460 million. Domestic revenues edged up 1% to $1,440 million while overseas sales were flat year over year (up 3% in constant currency) at $2,058 million.The Plasma Proteins business, where Baxter had encountered structural problems in the past, performed well with revenues of $416 million, up 9% (up 13% in constant currency) year over year. Antibody Therapy also delivered good results with sales of $386 million, climbing 10% (up 13% in constant currency) year over yearEstimate Revision TrendLoading...Loading...AgreementThe overall trend in estimate revisions for Baxter has seen minor activity in the recent past. Of the 16 analysts covering the stock, 1 raised his/her estimate, for the first quarter, over the last 7 days while there was no movement in the opposite direction. Moreover, one analyst increased his/her estimate, for the quarter, during the past month while there were no instances of downward movement.Estimates for 2011 have been inclined towards the positive side, with 2 out of 19 analysts raising his/her forecast over the prior week and 4 hiking their forecasts during the past month. There were no downward revisions during these timeframes. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2011 is $4.20, reflecting an estimated 5.62% year-over-year increase.MagnitudeGiven the relative shortage of estimate revisions, the magnitude of revisions for the forthcoming quarter has hit a plateau over the last week and month.Baxter has produced positive surprises in the previous three quarters and we expect a similar trend to continue. The company produced an average positive earnings surprise of 2.04% over the prior four quarters, meaning that it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by that measure.Our TakeThe news regarding Baxter remains mixed. On the positive side, Baxter's focus on life-sustaining products, which are not commoditized, partly insulates it from an economic downturn.

The company is extending its hand to the World Federation of Hemophilia (“WFH”) to start Advocacy in Action, a creative, multi-year project to assist nations play an advocacy role for victims of bleeding disorders.Baxter is funding this initiative with a grant. Furthermore, Advocacy in Action's role is intertwined with the WFH theme for World Hemophilia Day, which is “Be Inspired, Get Involved in Treatment for All”. Since its inception, in honor of Frank Schnabel in 1989, World Hemophilia Day (observed on April 17) has played a key role in heightening awareness of hemophilia and various bleeding problems.The overall longevity of hemophilia victims, in certain areas of the developed world, has crossed 60 years. Despite progress, wide disparities remain as 3 out of 4 victims do not receive proper medical care.According to WFH, its purpose is to make sure that all victims are diagnosed and receive treatment for their condition. For its part, Advocacy in Action is geared to accomplish this mission, which will lead to favorable results across the globe.Advocacy in Action is empowered to bolster WFH's national member organizations' (“NMOs”) capability to lobby their governments on behalf of those suffering from bleeding disorders. The effort includes specially crafted advocacy support, such as workshops, coaching programs and staffing to help implement public policy.Besides the new advocacy initiative, Baxter continues to support WFH's Global Alliance for Progress (“GAP”) program as its founder cum leading sponsor. Since its inception in 2003, over 22,000 victims have been diagnosed with bleeding problems in 16 nations and over 13,000 health care experts and regulators trained on the subject. Baxter has also reached out to hemophilia patients living in underserved nations.Baxter remains at the forefront of R&D efforts to treat hemophilia A and B and von Willebrand disease (a bleeding disorder afflicting both genders).

477,7967,Medical Devices Industry Outlook – April 2011 - Industry Outlook,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/03/968548/medical-devices-industry-outl,2011-03-31,BDX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Last year was challenging for medical device companies given the exigent economic conditions and an uncertain healthcare environment. The MedTech industry was hit by several macro headwinds in 2010 including price/volume and utilization pressure and a more restrictive regulatory environment. Although a number of these issues remain, the industry is expected to fare better this year due to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest medical devices market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The medical devices industry is divided into different segments such as Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic, Aesthetic Devices and Healthcare IT (“HCIT”). The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, thanks to an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic represent the fastest growing categories.The MedTech industry faced a host of issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks. While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product launches, an aging population, geographic expansion and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.With several growth constraints in the legacy markets, medical device companies are aiming to expand into lucrative new markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies may hit their bottom lines. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling healthcare costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.Increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from the healthcare reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical device companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.Regulatory Landscape - The 510(k) ReformThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, on August 3, 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan on January 19, 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator has shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies. President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine, which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review with feedback expected in mid-2011. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.The FDA plans to implement its new set of plans through a process of regulatory actions such as draft guidance and proposed regulations, which will be open to public feedback. CDRH stated that it will wait for the pending review report of the Institute of Medicine before making a final decision. Moreover, the regulator is planning for a public meeting in April 2011 to seek feedback on two other issues.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still struggling economy, top-tier devices makers are expected to continue their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in delivering operational synergies from these acquisitions, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions.OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, Neuro, radiation oncology and blood-related products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific CorporationLoading...Loading...(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(AMBD),Cyberonics Inc.(CYBX),Varian Medical(VAR),Accuray Incorporated(ARAY),Haemonetics Corporation(HAE).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and procedure growth headwinds) in the cardiovascular space in the wake of recovery. In addition, low global penetration and robust demand provides a positive long-term thesis for investing in the blood processing industry. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: Long-Term WinnersWith a slew of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment. However, we do acknowledge the fact that a soft CRM market may be a drag on these stocks. The prevailing macroeconomic factors, pricing pressure, austerity measures and the impact of health care reform are expected to continue to weigh on the CRM market through 2011.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in Cardiovascular, Neuro, Spinal, Diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company lost some U.S. ICD market share in the most recent quarter due to competition, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device. While Protecta ICD has yet to be cleared in the U.S., it continues to perform very well in Europe.We believe that the recent approval of the REVO MRI SureScan pacemaker and Arctic Front catheter should provide some support to Medtronic's CRM business. Its spinal segment should also benefit gradually from the recent product launches.Moreover, Medtronic plans to adopt restructuring initiatives (including workforce reduction) to sustain long-term growth. The company is also blessed with strong cash flows which it prudently uses for maximizing shareholder value. Medtronic is active on the acquisition front and is investing in emerging markets, which it considers an increasingly important growth driver.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership position in the global drug eluting stent (“DES”) market with 35% share (46% in the US market). Importantly, its pipeline DES product Promus Element is shaping up to be a major driver of its stent business. Moreover, we are also encouraged by Boston Scientic's acquisition of asthma-treatment company Asthmatx, which will enable it to target the pulmonary devices area.Boston Scientific has undertaken a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives that are expected to contribute to the bottom line moving forward. The company plans to expand its footprint in the emerging markets by reinvesting the savings from restructuring efforts. In this context, we reckon the company's divestiture of its Neurovascular business as a smart move, enabling it to prepay a portion of the debt and invest in high growth markets.St. Jude is poised to grow its market share in the CRM segment (especially in ICDs), driven by its new Fortify and Unify lines of devices. Launch of several products (including the quadripolar CRT systems) in the U.S. and Europe should boost the company's CRM market share in 2011. Moreover, we are optimistic about the emerging opportunity in the intravascular imaging market, enabled by the company's LightLab acquisition in July 2010.St. Jude's EnSite mapping system for diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmia continues to be the key driving force in atrial fibrillation. Also, its $1.3 billion acquisition of heart devices maker AGA Medical Holdings will eventually make St. Jude a clear leader in the structural heart market. The company expects the acquisition to help its sales grow at a low double-digit rate in 2011.Beyond the MedTech giants, an interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements.We also believe that cardiac assist devices-maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth. Based on healthy Impella demand trend, Abiomed has raised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2011.We are also optimistic about companies in the radiation oncology market such as Varian and Accuray. The radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements which are expected to boost the performance of these companies in 2011.Accuray is a global leader in the field of radiosurgery and continues to enjoy healthy demand for its CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery systems as evidenced by sustained growth in the number of patients receiving treatment with the device. Notably, the company's acquisition of its rivalTomoTherapy(TOMO) will reinforce its foothold in the radiation oncology space.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its coveted RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.Emerging Markets: An Opportunity to DiversifyThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets. Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for the incumbent players such asVolcano Corp.(VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit rate over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Hospital Spending: A Potential Tailwind?A soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for the MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession. However, recent quarterly results indicate signs of recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. This may turn into a potential driver moving forward.Federal “Stimulus”: A Boon for HCITsAnother area which is interestingly poised for growth these days is Healthcare IT. The landscape has changed since the Obama Administration took initiatives to encourage hospitals and physicians to modernize their health record-keeping as part of the “Stimulus Package.” The Stimulus is aimed at increasing the use of electronic health record (EHR) systems by medical practitioners.Optimism about the growth prospects of HCIT service providers has improved since the Stimulus package. Moreover, the “meaningful use” rule that enables hospitals to qualify for federal incentive program will boost business opportunities for the incumbents in the long-run. Beneficiaries of the Stimulus includeAllscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions(MDRX) andQuality Systems(QSII).WEAKNESSESJapan Debacle: Hurting MedTechThe impact of the recent massive earthquake (and subsequent Tsunami) in Japan and its aftermath on the medical devices industry appears to be substantial. Japan is the second-largest medical devices market after the U.S. It accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region.The roughly $25 billion Japanese medical devices sector has been an extremely successful market for American medical devices firms. U.S. firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.MedTech majors such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific andJohnson & Johnson's(JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan.The impact of the horrific disaster has been already felt as it has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It will inevitably result in delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products. Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis (as reflected in falling share prices), which is hard to gauge at this moment.Orthopedic Still a ConcernWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain until we see a complete economic recovery. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness. Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA).However, we do admit that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for players such as Stryker and Zimmer.Pricing Woes LingerPricing concerns on hips, knees and spine products have impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010. The pricing issue, at a macro-level, remains a key concern. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.A Broken BackThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience weak spine sales, which have somewhat shaken our confidence in these stocks.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market over the next few quarters. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Procedure Volume: Stabilizing but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe. The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010.A general sluggishness in the orthopedic industry has been evident from the weak sales reported by most of the leading players in this market. Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. On a somewhat positive note, recent trends indicate favorable procedure (hip/knees) volume growth, mostly likely due to pent-up patient demand. While this may point to a bounce-back, a material turnaround is not likely in 2011.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportACCURAY INC (ARAY): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCYBERONICS INC (CYBX): Free Stock Analysis ReportHAEMONETICS CP (HAE): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportTOMOTHERAPY INC (TOMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

The company stated that its almost 1,500-strong Japan-based workforce is not in danger. Its office in Tokyo is open to business, its plant in Shizuoka is operational and its distribution centers are unharmed. Covidien derived approximately 8% of its revenues in fiscal 2010 from sales in Japan.The company is working in tandem with humanitarian and relief organizations to support the aid process underway. It will donate not less than $1 million for the Japanese people.Covidien is a leading global healthcare products company that develops and markets medical solutions for better patient outcomes. The company's core medical devices business faces stiff competition from the likes ofJohnson & Johnson(JNJ),Becton Dickinson(BDX) andC.R. Bard(BCR).Covidien boasts of a well diversified product and technology portfolio. The company remains committed to rolling out new products and technologies, focusing on fast-growing markets and boosting market share in core segments through investments in sales and marketing infrastructure.The acquisition of eV3, in July 2010, bolstered Covidien's foothold in the peripheral vascular and neurovascular markets. Moreover, the divestiture of its specialty chemicals and sleep therapy product line enabled Covidien to rationalize its product portfolio and reallocate resources to faster-growing, higher-margined businesses.In January 2011, Covidien announced a favorable royalty agreement withMasimo Corporation(MASI) for its sales of pulse oximetry equipment. It is expected to provide some financial benefit going forward as well as allow Covidien more operational freedom. If Covidien adds hemoglobin monitoring to its platform of products, then the royalty rate will necessarily increase.On the somewhat somber side, Covidien's Pharmaceuticals business remains challenged by aggressive competition and heightened generic pressure.

The New Jersey-based company stated that all of its employees in Japan are safe and its Tokyo office is undamaged.Becton's Japanese operations are led by its subsidiary Nippon Becton Dickinson Company, located in Tokyo, and a manufacturing and distribution facility in Fukushima. The company has temporality closed its manufacturing plant and distribution center in Fukushima prefecture while it assesses damage there.Becton is actively working with various non-profit disaster relief and humanitarian aid organizations, including American Red Cross and U.S. Fund for UNICEF, to assess Japan's need for healthcare products. The company has donated $325,000 as part of its relief efforts for victims of the disaster, which will be distributed among relief organizations.Becton is a world leader in safety needle products. The company faces a wide range of competitors, includingBaxter International(BAX), in each of its three business segments. Becton enjoys growing international sales and maintains a focus on geographical expansion into overseas markets, in particular, emerging markets, which account for over 20% of its sales. Japan contributed roughly 5% of its total sales in fiscal 2010.We remain cautious about Becton due to the lack of any major short-term catalyst. The rising demand for safety-needle was the primary driver of the company's growth in the past, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is mostly penetrated. Nevertheless, Becton anticipates that future sales will be driven by strong demand for its next-generation safety pen needles, which is expected to be launched in second-half fiscal 2011.We are optimistic that growth may recover in the future with the European Union adoption of safety needle requirements and recovery in research markets.

A medical isotope, technetium-99m, is used in more than 80% of nuclear medicine studies. Covidien's Mallinckrodt unit supplies this product to nuclear pharmacies and hospitals.Technetium-99m is formed when molybdenum-99 decays after uranium irradiation. The FDA's approval permits use of low-enriched uranium-based molybdenum-99 (provided by South Africa-based NTP Radioisotopes, Ltd.; a subsidiary of the Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa) in Technetium-99m generator production, at Covidien's manufacturing unit located in Maryland Heights, Missouri.Technetium-99m, which is a vital medical isotope, is utilized for functional and diagnostic research of organs. Data from such studies is utilized by medical practitioners to correctly diagnose patients. Over 30 million nuclear medicine procedures are annually performed across the world, utilizing Technetium-99m, with over 50% based in the U.S.In early 2009, Covidien initiated a project, with Babcock & Wilcox Technical Services Group, to come up with solution-based reactor know how for low-enriched uranium-based medical isotope production. This new methodology is designed to ensure an efficient local source. The joint effort utilizes both Covidien's knowledge in radiopharmaceutical production and regulatory approvals and its partner's patented liquid phase nuclear know how.

Earnings for the quarter topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues fell short of forecast primarily due to a drop in domestic sales.As in the previous quarter, Becton, Dickinson again experienced higher growth in emerging markets, which accounted for over 20% of revenues.Among some noteworthy sub segments, Diabetes Care did well with sales shooting up 6.1% year over year. However, this was offset by lackluster performance by several business units, including Pharmaceutical Systems (down 15.3%), and Diagnostic Systems (down 2.6%).Despite indifferent results in the short term, Becton, Dickinson's long-term guidance remains robust. Both revenues and adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow at an encouraging pace till fiscal 2013. Furthermore, margins have improved following the company's cost containment and efficiency measures. Becton, Dickinson's cash flow remains strong and management is committed to efficiently deploying cash flow for increasing returns to shareholders through its sizeable share repurchase program.We remain cautious about Becton, Dickinson due to the lack of any major short-term catalyst. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is predominantly already penetrated. On the other hand, Becton, Dickinson anticipates that future sales will be driven by strong demand for its next-generation safety pen needles, which will be launched in the second half of the current fiscal year.We are hopeful that growth may recover in the future with the European Union adoption of safety needle requirements and recovery in research markets.

487,7977,Gen-Probe Reiterated Neutral - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/03/912289/gen-probe-reiterated-neutral-,2011-03-08,BDX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...We reaffirm our Neutral recommendation on diagnostic products makerGen-Probe(GPRO) following its mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2010 results. Earnings for the quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, helped by lower costs and tax. However, revenues declined 2% year over year, in part due to lower blood screening product sales, missing the forecast.Product revenues slipped 3% in the fourth quarter as higher sales from clinical diagnostic products were eclipsed by double-digit declines across the blood screening and research products and services businesses.Gen-Probe's blood screening products business struggled in the quarter with sales tumbling 11% on account of lower sales of TIGRIS systems to partnerNovartis(NVS), which the company expects to continue through 2011.California-based Gen-Probe develops and markets nucleic acid products for clinical diagnostics and blood screening as well as products for detecting harmful microorganisms in environmental and industrial settings. It has been a pioneer in the commercial and scientific development of nucleic acid testing (“NAT”) for the diagnosis of infectious diseases.Gen-Probe is a dominant player in the rapidly expanding NAT market, the fastest growing segment of the clinical diagnostic market. It is a market leader in domestic gonorrhea and chlamydia testing with its PACE and APTIMA assay product lines.Gen-Probe has a strong pipeline of novel assay products that are expected to be the harbinger of future growth. Moreover, the company boasts a reasonably sound balance sheet and is making prudent use of healthy free cash flows by means of acquisitions and overseas expansion initiatives as well as rewarding shareholders through share repurchases.We view the company's acquisition of specialty diagnostics firm GTI Diagnostics in late 2010 as a positive step, providing a boost to its top line.We believe Gen-Probe is well placed with a slew of new products that are expected to usher growth in the years ahead. Moreover, the ongoing market shift away from traditional diagnostic methods towards molecular testing represents a tailwind for the company.However, Gen-Probe is faced with increased competition in a maturing blood screening market. The company competes with more established firms in the molecular diagnostics industry such asRoche(RHHBY),Becton Dickinson(BDX) andAbbott Labs(ABT). Moreover, Gen-Probe's clinical diagnostics products are susceptible to reimbursement risks and its international sales are subject to foreign exchange swings and price regulations.The company's blood screening franchise may remain under pressure moving forward due to a soft market condition and fewer TIGRIS systems sold to Novartis. Also, the dilutive impact of rising costs associated with product development represents a headwind for the stock. All these factors lead us to tread with caution. Our recommendation is backed by a short-term Zacks #3 Rank (Hold).Loading...Loading...ABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportGEN-PROBE INC (GPRO): Free Stock Analysis ReportNOVARTIS AG-ADR (NVS): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."
488,7978,Baxter Vaccine Wins rMRP Approval - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/03/900948/baxter-vaccine-wins-rmrp-appr,2011-03-03,BDX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Baxter International(BAX), a global diversified medical products company, recently announced that the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety recently granted approval of a European repeat mutual recognition procedure (“rMRP”) for its Preflucel seasonal influenza vaccine. The license will be formally implemented by 13 European nations, including Germany, the U.K. and Spain, to render Preflucel widely available during the 2011-2012 influenza season.Preflucel, which is a seasonal vaccine comprised of inactivated and purified split influenza virions, is the outcome of a committed product development effort to provide a tolerable and useful vaccine that can be reliably manufactured during each and every influenza season. It is produced using Baxter's Vero cell technology, which ensures an innovative methodology for producing vaccine, versus the traditional embryonated chicken egg production.Preflucel is indicated as a prophylaxis of flu for adults including the elderly. It is deemed suitable for those who suffer from egg or antibiotic-related allergies. The vaccine is free of antibiotics, preservatives as well as egg proteins.Baxter is enthused by the approval of Preflucel in Austria. Also, a recent study pointed to tolerability and effectiveness of Preflucel as a safeguard against seasonal flu. It found 78.5% protective efficacy against the flu strains in the vaccine and relatively minor adverse event profile.The immunogenicity, safety and protective efficacy of Preflucel was established by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial conducted with over 7,200 fit volunteers, in the U.S., during the course of the 2008-2009 flu season.The news regarding Baxter remains mixed. On the positive side, Baxter's focus on life-sustaining products, which are not commoditized, partly insulates it from an economic downturn. The company is able to generate recurring revenues, and consistent cash flow, due to its focus on chronic diseases.On the flip side, despite recent improvement in Plasma Proteins and Antibody Therapy sub-segments, we are concerned about stagnation in sales, a still somber outlook for hospital spending and tightening of reimbursement.The lingering bearishness surrounding the stock can be lifted by consistent execution. Baxter is a good bet for value investors willing to wait as fundamentals improve. Among others, it competes withBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) andTalecris Biotherapeutics Holdings Corp.(TLCR) in certain niches.

For the full year, adjusted earnings of $2.19 per share also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.14 and the year-ago earnings of $1.95.Revenue AnalysisRevenues for the quarter slipped 2% year over year $136.7 million due to lower product sales, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $137 million.Product sales dipped 3% year over year to $131.1 million as higher clinical diagnostic revenues were more than offset by double-digit declines across the blood screening and research products and services businesses. For fiscal 2010, revenues climbed 9% year over year to $543.3 million, but narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $544 million.Clinical diagnostic sales rose 3% to $80.1 million in the fourth quarter, supported by the higher sales of APTIMA Combo 2 assay, partly offset by a decline in PRODESSE influenza assay revenues. Blood screening products revenues clipped 11% year over year to $47.6 million owing to lower sales of TIGRIS systems to Gen-Probe's strategic partnerNovartis(NVS), which the company expects to continue through 2011.Revenues from research products and services slid 23% year over year to $3.4 million, primarily due to the divestiture of the BioKits food testing business in 2009. Unfavorable foreign exchange movements hit sales across all product categories.Collaborative research sales catapulted 85% to $3.7 million boosted by increased funding from Novartis for the development of blood screening products such as the fully automated PANTHER instrument and the PROCLEIX ULTRIO Plus assay. Royalty and license revenues surged 36% to $1.9 million.Margins & ExpensesGross margin on product sales for the quarter increased to 69.4% from 67.2% a year-ago. Research and development expenses decreased 2% year over year to $26.9 million. Marketing and sales expenses were relatively flat year over year at $15 million.Loading...Loading...Balance Sheet, Cash flow & Share RepurchasesGen-Probe exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $489.7 million, down 2.3% year over year, and short-term debt of $240 million (flat year over year). The company generated $43.8 million in cash flows from operations during the quarter and invested $8.6 million in capital expenditure, resulting in a free cash flow of $35.2 million.The company bought back 245,000 shares for $11.9 million in the fourth quarter to conclude its $100 million repurchase program.The Board has authorized a fresh $150 million share repurchase program, underscoring the company's commitment to maximize shareholder value.OutlookLooking ahead, Gen-Probe envisions high single-digit growth in product revenues and expects improving margins to drive healthy earnings growth. However, the company expects decline in instrument sales in 2011.Gen-Probe expects revenues for fiscal 2011 in the range of $570 million to $595 million. Adjusted earnings per share for the year have been projected in the range of $2.28 to $2.40.Moreover, Gen-Probe expects adjusted operating margin between 27% and 29% while product gross margin target has been pegged at 68%-69.5%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for 2011 revenue and EPS are $583 million and $2.36, respectively.Gen-Probe is one of the leading players in the clinical diagnostic space and is poised for growth in a rapidly expanding market for molecular diagnostic tests. Moreover, a slew of new products are expected to usher growth in the coming years.Gen-Probe completed five regulatory submissions in the U.S. in 2010, of which, it has filed for the APTIMA human papilloma virus and APTIMA trichomonas assays in the fourth quarter.However, Gen-Probe competes with more established firms such asRoche(RHHBY),Becton Dickinson(BDX) andAbbott Labs(ABT) in a maturing molecular diagnostic industry.Moreover, the company's clinical diagnostics products are susceptible to reimbursement risk and its international sales are subject to foreign exchange swings and price regulations.

490,7980,Earnings Scorecard: Becton - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/02/858490/earnings-scorecard-becton-ana,2011-02-14,BDX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Becton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) recently announced first-quarter fiscal 2011 (ended December 31) results. Adjusted (excluding one-time items) earnings per share of $1.35 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 and surpassed the year-ago figure of $1.30. Net income from continuing operations (on a reported basis) for the quarter increased 3.3% to roughly $314 million (or $1.35 a share).The Results in BriefBecton Dickinson recorded revenues of $1.84 billion for the reported quarter, down 1.4% (or 1.5% in constant currency) year over year, and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 billionDomestic sales for the quarter were $829 million, down 2.9% year over year, which includes a negative impact of 6% from the flu pandemic in the preceding year. Ex-U.S. revenues were $1.01 billion, down 0.2% (or 0.3% in constant currency), owing to a negative 3% impact from the flu pandemic. Becton, Dickinson experienced higher growth in emerging markets, which was offset by the slowdown in European markets.We have discussed the quarterly results at length here:Becton 1Q Mixed, Profit Inches UpAgreement – Estimate RevisionsThe overall trend in estimate revisions for fiscal 2011 is mixed, with a downward bias, following the release of the first quarter results. Out of the 19 analysts covering the stock, 4 raised their estimates over the past week while 7 lowered their forecasts.  A similar pattern applies for fiscal 2012 with 4 analysts (out of 18) raising their forecast and 8 lowering the same over the identical timeframe.The mixed sentiment was fueled by headwinds from several factors such as lack of positive triggers and lackluster sales growth.Loading...Loading...Magnitude – Consensus Estimate TrendDownward directional agreement, for the most past, has led to a 1 cent decline in the forecast for fiscal 2011 and a 4 cent drop for fiscal 2012. The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for fiscal 2011 and 2012 are $5.51 and $6.10, respectively, reflecting an estimated 12.5% and 10.67% year-over-year growth.Becton Dickinson Stays at NeutralBecton, Dickinson continues to forecast revenue growth of 4% year over year for fiscal 2011. The company still expects reported earnings per share from continuing operations to grow about 11% to 13% to a range of $5.45 to $5.55. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, for fiscal 2011, has been projected to grow in a band of 10% to 12%, unchanged from the earlier view.We remain cautious about Becton, Dickinson due to the lack of major short-term catalysts. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is predominantly already penetrated. Further, Becton, Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors in each of its three business segments.We are, however, hopeful that growth may recover in the future with the European Union adoption of safety requirements, recovery in research markets and continued growth in flow cytometry in the clinical setting. Becton, Dickinson's preeminent global healthcare products franchise is partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the healthcare delivery field.The company competes, in niches, with different companies such asBaxter International(BAX) among others.

491,7981,Earnings Scorecard: Baxter - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/02/847796/earnings-scorecard-baxter-ana,2011-02-09,BDX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Baxter International(BAX) reported fourth quarter and fiscal 2010 adjusted (excluding one-time items) earnings per share of $1.11 and $3.98, respectively, thereby beating the corresponding Zacks Consensus Estimates of $1.10 and $3.97, and surpassing the year-ago results of $1.03 and $3.80.The results were in line with Baxter's earlier guidance in the range of $1.09 to $1.11 for the fourth quarter and $3.96 to $3.98 for fiscal 2010. Among the positive factors, Baxter retains a strong product pipeline with several products in late-stage clinical development.Highlights from the Fourth QuarterReported net income dropped 26% year over year, in the fourth quarter, to $423 million (or 72 cents per share). This decline mainly resulted from special after-tax charges of $227 million for asset impairment and costs related to Baxter's initiatives in the area of business optimization, higher reserves for litigation and in-process R&D expenses.Total revenues were $3,498 million, up 1% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,460 million. Domestic revenues for the quarter edged up 1% to $1,440 million while overseas sales were flat year over year (up 3% in constant currency) at $2,058 million.The Plasma Proteins business, where Baxter had encountered structural problems in the past, performed well with revenues of $416 million, up 9% (up 13% in constant currency) year over year. Antibody Therapy also delivered good results with sales of $386 million, climbing 10% (up 13% in constant currency) year over year.We have discussed the quarterly results at length here:Baxter Beats on EPS, Net DipsAgreement – Estimate RevisionsThe overall trend in estimate revisions for fiscal 2011 is essentially static since the release of the fourth quarter results with none of the analysts (out of 19) raising or lowering their estimates over the past 7 days. A similar pattern applies to the estimates for 2012.Average execution simply failed to evoke sentiment despite the company's retention of market share in infusion pumps and ongoing turnaround of the Plasma Proteins business.Loading...Loading...Magnitude – Consensus Estimate TrendA lack of movement in estimates has led to magnitude hitting a plateau for both the current and subsequent fiscal year.  The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for fiscal 2011 and 2012 are $4.20 and $4.64, respectively, reflecting an estimated 5.58% and 10.32% year-over-year growth.Baxter Stays at NeutralThe news regarding Baxter remains mixed. On the positive side, Baxter's focus on life-sustaining products, which are not commoditized, partly insulates it from an economic downturn. The company is able to generate recurring revenues, and consistent cash flow, due to its focus on chronic diseases.On the flip side, despite recent improvement in Plasma Proteins and Antibody Therapy sub-segments, we are concerned about stagnation in sales, a still somber outlook for some hospital spending and tightening of reimbursement.The lingering bearishness surrounding the stock can be lifted by consistent execution. Baxter is a good bet for value investors willing to wait as fundamentals improve. Among others, it competes withBecton, Dickinson and Company(BDX) andTalecris Biotherapeutics Holdings Corp.(TLCR) in certain niches. We currently have a Neutral long-term rating on Baxter supported by a short-term Zacks #3 Rank.About Earnings Estimate ScorecardLen Zacks, PhD in mathematics from MIT, proved over 30 years ago that earnings estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices.

Net income from continuing operations (on a reported basis) for the quarter increased 3.3% to about $314 million (or $1.35 a share).RevenuesBecton, Dickinson recorded revenues of $1.84 billion for the reported quarter, down 1.4% year over year (or 1.5% in constant currency), missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 billion.Domestic sales amounted to $829 million, down 2.9% year over year, including a negative impact of 6% from the flu pandemic in the preceding year.

As in the previous quarter, Becton, Dickinson again experienced higher growth in emerging markets, which was offset by the slowdown in European markets.Segment-wise ResultsIn BD Medical, global revenues were $927 million, down 4.5% year over year (down 4.3% in constant currency) in the reported quarter. Higher revenues from Diabetes Care products were more than offset by an unfavorable comparison of 6% due to sales related to the H1N1 flu pandemic in fiscal 2010.Among the sub-segments, Medical Surgical Systems was down 3.8% year over year (or 4.7% in constant currency) to $512.7 million in the first quarter, Diabetes Care was up 6.1% to $213.9 million and Pharmaceutical Systems dropped sharply by 15.3% (or 12.4% in constant currency) to $199.9 million.In BD Diagnostics, global sales were $602 million, up 1% (or 0.6% in constant currency). The performance of this segment was driven by robust revenues from Preanalytical Systems' safety-engineered products and Women's Health and Cancer items from the Diagnostic Systems unit. With regard to the sub-segments, Preanalytical Systems moved up 3.9% to $312.6 million and Diagnostic Systems dipped 2.6% to $289.1 million.In BD Biosciences, global sales were $314 million, up 3.7% (or 3.5% in constant currency). The favorable outcome was driven by cell analysis instrument as well as reagent sales. As for the sub-segments, Cell Analysis moved up 4.1% (or 4.2% in constant currency) to $240.7 million and Discovery Labware inched up 2.3% (or 1.2% in constant currency) to $73 million.Loading...Loading...MarginsGross margin edged up to 53% in the reported quarter from 52.1% a year ago while operating margin was 22.4%, lower than 23% in the prior-year quarter.Recent DevelopmentsOn February 7, 2011, Becton announced a definitive agreement to take over Accuri Cytometers, an Ann Arbor-based company, which makes personal flow cytometers for use by researchers.  The acquisition, whose terms were not disclosed, is synergistic with Becton's strategy for its Cell Analysis sub-segment.OutlookBecton Dickinson continues to forecast revenue growth of 4% year over year for fiscal 2011. The company still expects reported earnings per share from continuing operations to grow about 11% to 13% to a range of $5.45 to $5.55.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is $1.29, representing an estimated year-over-year decline of 1.11%.During the fourth quarter earnings announcement, the company had guided reported earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 to grow about 11% to 13% to a range of $5.45 to $5.55. It expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to grow in a band of 10% to 12% for fiscal 2011. During the last conference call, Becton Dickinson added that it forecasts fiscal 2011 revenues to increase about 4% year over year.Fourth-Quarter RecapBecton Dickinson reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2010 earnings of $1.24 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Total revenues increased 1% year over year (2.9% in constant currency) to $1.87 billion, with growth varying somewhat across business segments. Revenues were mostly in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Domestic sales for the quarter amounted to $832 million, up 1.4% year over year, including a negative impact of 1.8% from the flu pandemic. Overseas revenues were $1.04 billion, up 0.8% (or 4.2% in constant currency), including a negative impact of 4% from the flu pandemic in fiscal 2009. Becton Dickinson experienced higher growth in emerging markets, offset by a slowdown in European markets.Estimate Revision TrendLoading...Loading...AgreementThe overall trend in estimate revisions for the upcoming quarter is relatively static. Of the 16 analysts covering the stock, there was no upward revision during the past 7 days accompanied by just one downward movement. Two analysts raised their estimates in the past month while two lowered their forecasts.With regard to fiscal 2011, only one analyst (out of 17) lifted his/her estimate over the last week with no reverse movements. Over the past month, four analysts have raised their estimates while one moved in the opposite direction. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2011 is $5.52, reflecting an estimated 12.7% year-over-year growth.MagnitudeGiven the relative lack of estimate revisions, the magnitude of revision reached a plateau, for both the past 7 and 30 days, for the forthcoming quarter. There was an increase of a cent over the past month for fiscal 2011.Our Take on Becton DickinsonBecton Dickinson, a leading global medical technology company, produces and markets medical devices, instrument systems and reagents. The company is dedicated to enhancing drug delivery, improving the pace of diagnosing infectious diseases and cancer and advancing R&D for new drugs.We remain cautious about Becton Dickinson due to the lack of any major short-term catalyst. The rising demand for safety-needle products (with higher price points and margins) was the primary driver of the company's past growth, which is not expected to continue, given that the U.S. market is predominantly already penetrated. Further, Becton Dickinson faces a wide range of competitors in each of its three business segments.We are, however, hopeful that growth may recover in the future with the European Union adoption of safety requirements, recovery in research markets and continued growth in flow cytometry in the clinical setting. Becton Dickinson's preeminent global healthcare products franchise is partly insulated from volatile macroeconomic conditions and structural deficiencies elsewhere in the healthcare delivery field.Cash flow of the company remains strong and management is committed to efficiently deploying cash flow for increasing returns to shareholders through its share repurchase program.The company competes, in niches, with different companies such asBaxter International(BAX) among others.

695,10414,BofA Finalizes CCB Stake Sale - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/08/1891828/bofa-finalizes-ccb-stake-sal,2011-08-30,BLK,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...On August 29, 2011,Bank of America Corp.(BAC) announced that it has socked a deal with a group of investors to sell about half of its stake in China Construction Bank (“CCB”) for approximately $8.3 billion.  This is part of BofA's effort to strengthen its capital position in order to reinstate dividend hike and meet new international capital standards.The CCB stake sale has long been anticipated by the market. However, market turbulence in recent weeks made the deal uncertain.Bloomberg data showed that the company is the second largest stake holder in CCB, the world's second largest bank by value, after the 59% right held by the Chinese government. Following the divestiture of 13.1 billion of CCB common shares, BofA will still continue as a strategic investor in CCB withabout 5% stake.The proposed Basel III standards set a ceiling of less than 10% stake in any financial institution. The reduction in the CCB stake would help BofA to readily comply with the requirement.The deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2011, is expected to generate an after-tax gain of approximately $3.3 billion during the quarter. The transaction is also likely to help the company generate about $3.5 billion in additional Tier 1 common capital and reduce risk-weighted assets by $7.3 billion under Basel I.In 2005, BofA had paid $3 billion for a 9.9% stake in CCB, before CCB's IPO. The company further raised its stake by exercising the option to purchase an additional 11% for $9.2 billion.This is not the first time that BofA is selling its stake in CCB. In January 2009, the company had sold 2.5% holdings in CCB, reaping a profit of $1.1 billion. Further, in May 2009, the company sold another 9.9% stake leading to a pre-tax profit of $7.3 billion. Also, in 2010, the company sold its right to buy another 1.79 billion shares in CCB to Temasek Holdings Pte, Singapore's state investment company.Worries about BofA's ability to meet regulatory capital requirement and maintain profitability have significantly eclipsed the bank's stock price. However, the $5 billion investment made by Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway(BRK.B) in the company on August 25, 2011, was real a confidence booster.Also, the market expectation is that BofA requires about $50 billion additional capital in the coming years to meet global capital standards. Amusingly, BofA has already generated about $30 billion from non-core asset shedding initiatives in the last six quarters.The company hopes to fulfill the regulatory capital requirement through organic means, aided by the sustained paring of non-core assets. However, we speculate that the company would need to issue some shares to meet the capital requirement.Besides fulfilling the capital requirements, BofA's plan to sell its stake in CCB is part of its long-term strategy to remove non-core assets from its balance sheet as the company looks to concentrate more on businesses that directly serve customers, as well as fortify its balance sheet.BofA has also broached talks withThe Blackstone Group(BX) to sell real estate assets held by its Merrill Lynch unit for nearly $1 billion.Moreover, early this month, the company agreed to sell its Canadian credit-card unit toToronto-Dominion Bank(TD) for $7.6 billion.BofA also shed a number of non-core assets earlier this year as well as the last. Among others, BofA sold 43.6 million of itsBlackRock Inc.(BLK) shares for $163 each in November 2010. Furthermore, the company sold an additional 2.5 million shares of BlackRock to Japan's third-biggest bank Mizuho Financial Group Inc. Also, in July 2010, BofA completed the sale ofFirst Republic Bank(FRC) for $1.86 billion to a group of investors led byColony Financial Inc.(CLNY) and General Atlantic LCC.Besides hiving off non-core assets, BofA is also planning to retrench 3,500 workers this quarter as the company is fraught with its $1 trillion problem-loan portfolio. Also, thousands of additional layoffs could ensue in the upcoming quarters as the company is working on a broader restructuring plan to recover its financial position. Though BofA is still deliberating about the extent of the job cut, the number might go beyond 10,000 as part of a wider review.We do not see an end to this non-core divestiture in the recent future. With BofA's plan to boost dividend in the second half of 2011 being turned down by the Federal Reserve in March, the company sees this as an inevitable way to shore up capital strength and fortify its balance sheet.Loading...Loading...Currently, BofA retains a Zacks #4 Rank, which translates into a short-term Sell rating. However, considering the fundamentals, we maintain a long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock.BANK OF AMER CP (BAC): Free Stock Analysis ReportBLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportBERKSHIRE HTH-B (BRK.B): Free Stock Analysis ReportBLACKSTONE GRP (BX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCOLONY FINL INC (CLNY): Free Stock Analysis ReportFIRST REP BK SF (FRC): Free Stock Analysis ReportTORONTO DOM BNK (TD): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

702,10421,BofA Continues to Shed Assets - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/08/1864626/bofa-continues-to-shed-asset,2011-08-17,BLK,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...On Wednesday,The Financial Timesreported thatBank of America Corporation(BAC) is in advance talks withThe Blackstone Group(BX) to the sell real estate assets held by its Merrill Lynch unit for nearly $1 billion. The company had acquired Merrill Lynch in late 2008.BofA has been trying to remove property investments worth $800 million to $1 billion in Europe, South America and the U.S. The portfolio, which BofA wants to sell, includes a large number of real estate debt and equity positions across various countries, such as stakes in logistics properties in central Europe, nonperforming loans in Italy, a Brazilian property developer and shopping centers in Spain.As of June 30, 2011, BofA had investments and unfunded commitments of $1.7 billion in global real estate portfolio, down from $2.2 billion as of June 30, 2010. Hence, the closure of the deal would mostly complete BofA's efforts to divest the real estate part of its principal investments unit that also includes private equity and other investments made by using the company's own money.Though the spokespersons for both BofA and Blackstone refused to comment on the deal, some reliable sources stated that the transaction could still be called off.BofA and Blackstone were in relation before as well. In 2010, BofA and Blackstone had entered into a transaction under which Blackstone was assigned to manage BofA's Asian real estate investment portfolio worth $2 billion at that time.Considering various regulatory changes and new rules, including the Volcker rule being implemented following the financial crisis, the U.S. financial institutions have been trying to realign their balance sheets in order to comply with them. The Volcker rule limits the way banks can invest their own capital. Furthermore, the banks have been lowering their exposure to private equity investments as they would be required to hold more capital under the new Basel III regulatory rules.This is not the first time that BofA is going to be asset light by shedding its non-essential businesses and units. Earlier this week, BofA announced its plans to sell $8.6 billion Canadian credit card portfolio as well as certain other assets and liabilities of TD Bank Group and also exit from its credit card businesses in the U.K. and Ireland.In July, BofA had announced a deal to sell its Balboa Life Insurance Co. and Balboa Life Insurance Co. of New York to Securian Financial Group Inc. Furthermore, in June, BofA announced the completion of the sale of Balboa Insurance Company and affiliated entities to Australia-based QBE Insurance Group. The company had inherited Balboa from Countrywide Financial, which it acquired in 2008. BofA also completed the spin-off of its last largest private equity fund in June, which led to the creation of a new company named North Cove Partners.Additionally, last year BofA undertook a number of non-core asset shedding actions. Among others, in November, BofA sold 43.6 million of itsBlackRock Inc.(BLK) shares for $163 each. Furthermore, the company sold an additional 2.5 million shares of BlackRock to Japan's third-biggest bank Mizuho Financial Group Inc. Also, in July 2010, BofA completed the sale ofFirst Republic Bank(FRC) for $1.86 billion to a group of investors led byColony Financial Inc.(CLNY) and General Atlantic LCC.With BofA's plan to boost dividend in the second half of 2011 being turned down by the Federal Reserve in March, the company will likely continue with its non-core asset shedding activities until its capital strength improves and balance sheet fortifies. BofA is looking to concentrate more on businesses that directly serve customers as well as strengthen its balance sheet.Furthermore, BofA had been facing an inquiry regarding its role in the foreclosure mess since last year. However, the company might soon settle a state and federal probe into foreclosure practices through a deal. This would bring some relief to the company and boost the investors' confidence in the stock. This justifies BofA's Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short term ‘Hold' rating.Loading...Loading...BANK OF AMER CP (BAC): Free Stock Analysis ReportBLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportBLACKSTONE GRP (BX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCOLONY FINL INC (CLNY): Free Stock Analysis ReportFIRST REP BK SF (FRC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

However, the earnings have fared well against the prior-year quarter's earnings of $1.03.Operating results exclude the consolidation of certain investment entities, net realized gains or losses, integration and restructuring charges, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and discontinued operations.Net income attributable to Ameriprise for the reported quarter came in at $313 million or $1.25 per share compared with $257 million or 97 cents per share in the comparable quarter last year.The second quarter results primarily benefited from increased asset-based fees and impressive results in Asset Management and Advice & Wealth Management segments. Also, the Columbia Management acquisition proved to be a tailwind for the company. However, higher expenses proved to be the dampener.Quarterly DetailsOn an operating basis, Ameriprise's net revenues for the second quarter rose 14% year over year to $2.59 billion. The improvement reflects a growth in asset-based fees from retail client net inflows, the acquisition of Columbia Management and market appreciation. However, net revenues stood below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.64 billion.GAAP expenses in the quarter climbed 11.2% year over year to $2.22 billion, while operating expenses escalated 12% from the year-ago quarter to $2.14 billion. These represent a significant increase in distribution expenses, general and administrative expenses along with benefits, claims, losses and settlement costs.Asset PositionTotal assets under management and administration grew 17% year over year to $670 billion as of June 30, 2011, attributable to the improvement in retail client net inflows and market appreciation.Loading...Loading...CapitalAmeriprise continues to maintain a strong liquidity with nearly $2.0 billion in excess capital, which, we believe, will help the company grow through acquisitions.Share RepurchaseDuring the quarter under review, Ameriprise repurchased 6.1 million shares of its common stock for $366 million under the $1.5 billion authorization announced by the company in May 2010. The company has $165 million shares remaining under its current authorization.Additionally during the quarter, Ameriprise announced a new share repurchase program, which is an extension of the earlier one. Under this new program, the company will be able to buy back its common shares worth $2 billion through June 28, 2013.Peer PerformanceOne of Ameriprise's competitors,BlackRock Inc.(BLK) reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $3.00 per share, fairly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92. Better-than-expected results were primarily aided by a strong top-line growth emanating from a better investment performance and asset mix, which were offset partially by higher operating expenses.Our ViewpointThough there is concern over the sluggish market recovery, an improvement in retail client activity and decent growth in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses would drive operating leverage in the upcoming quarters. We also expect the Columbia Management acquisition to provide far-reaching product distribution opportunities. Furthermore, Ameriprise's capital deployment activity would also boost investors' confidence in the stock.Ameriprise currently retains a Zacks # 3 Rank, which translates into a short-term ‘Hold' rating. Also, considering the fundamentals, we maintain our long-term “Neutral” recommendation on the stock.AMERIPRISE FINL (AMP): Free Stock Analysis ReportBLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

This also compares favorably with earnings of 27 cents in the prior-year quarter.On a GAAP basis, earnings came in at 39 cents per share compared with 38 cents in the prior quarter and 9 cents in the year-ago quarter.Invesco's earnings soared over the prior-year quarter primarily on an increase in net revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The company's assets under management also continued to grow during the quarter.Quarter in DetailInvesco's adjusted net income increased 8% sequentially and 65% year over year to $207.1 million.Adjusted net revenue increased 4% sequentially and 32% year over year to $751.2 million. On a sequential basis, revenues improved primarily on increases in investment management fees earned. Also, foreign exchange rate changes aided net revenue growth by $5.4 million. However, net revenue missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.1 billion.Adjusted investment management fees rose 4% sequentially and 29% year over year to $844.3 million. Service and distribution fees improved 4% sequentially and 48% year over year to $206.2 million.Adjusted operating expenses increased 3% sequentially and 22% year over year to $466.4 million. On a sequential basis, employee compensation expenses increased 4% to $310.9 million primarily on a full quarter of the annual base salary hikes and share-based awards.Also, the expenses for the quarter include a full quarter of the Hyderabad staff costs. Marketing expenses nudged up 2% from the prior quarter to $26.7 million.Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 37.9% compared with 37.6% in the prior quarter and 33.0% in the prior-year quarter.Assets Under ManagementIncreased market value, as a result of the gradual recovery in global equity markets, improved assets under management (AUM) 2% sequentially and 17% year over year to $653.7 billion as of June 30, 2011. Average AUM for the reported quarter was $652.8 billion compared with $630.2 billion in the prior quarter and $480.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.However, long-term net inflows were $3.8 billion compared with $6.6 billion in the prior quarter and $13.9 billion in the prior-year quarter. Institutional money market net inflows were $3.5 billion as against net inflows of $2.6 billion in the prior quarter and net outflows of $0.9 billion in the year-ago quarter.Loading...Loading...Dividend UpdateConcurrent with the earnings release, the company declared a second-quarter dividend of 12.25 cents per share. The dividend will be paid on September 8, 2011, to shareholders of record as of August 22, 2011.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, Invesco repurchased 11.3 million shares at a weighted average price of $24.69.Peer PerformanceLast week, one of Invesco's peers,BlackRock Inc.(BLK) reported second quarter 2011 adjusted earnings of $3.00 per share, fairly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92. Better-than-expected results were primarily aided by strong top-line growth, owing to better investment performance and asset mix, partially offset by higher operating expenses.Our TakeImproving long-term investment performance propelled by a gradual recovery in the global equity market is expected to boost operating results over the mid to long term. Though rising operating expenses will remain near-term headwinds, significant improvement in operating leverage from Invesco's cost control initiatives is expected over the long term. The company is also poised to benefit from improved global investment flows owing to its broad diversification.Invesco currently retains a Zacks # 3 Rank, which translates into a short-term ‘Hold' rating.

However, total revenue missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.34 billion.Total expenses remained almost flat sequentially but crept up 11% year over year to $1.48 billion.

The settlement is for a group of 22 investors who had suffered substantial losses for their investments in mortgage-backed securities sold by the company prior to the housing market failure.While the settlement is encouraging considering the fact that it lessens the overhang related to the mortgage repurchases liability, BofA's financials will face a massive blow in its second quarter. The company is even expected to be in the red.Settlement & Second Quarter ImpactThe agreement basically covers most of BofA's legacy Countrywide-issued first-lien residential mortgage-backed securitization (RMBS) repurchase exposure. It represents 530 trusts with original principal balance of $424 billion and total current unpaid principal balance of approximately $221 billion. The settlement, which is subject to the court approval, was reached withThe Bank of New York Mellon(BK), the trustee for the RMBS.BofA will make cash payment of 8.5 billion to settle the claims. Further, it would also provide an additional $5.5 billion in the second quarter of 2011 for representations and warranties liability for both Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSE) and non-GSE exposures. The company also estimates a $6.4 billion in other mortgage-related charges in the second quarter including a goodwill impairment charge of $2.6 billion.The company's second quarter 2011 results will bear the brunt of this settlement and other mortgage-related matters. Management currently expects second quarter net loss of $8.6–$9.1 billion, or 88–93 cents per share.However, after excluding the impact of this settlement as well as other mortgage-related and non-operating items, the company projects a second quarter net income of $3.2–$3.7 billion, or 28–33 cents per share.Loading...Loading...The AllegationsThe group of investors, including names such asBlackRock Inc.(BLK), Pacific Investment Management Co. and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York alleged that prior to the financial crisis, Countrywide Financial Corp., a company that was acquired by BofA in 2008, had sold those securities that were tied to bad-quality loans.Neither the quality of the borrowers nor the collaterals matched the standards that Countrywide assured to the buyer of these securities. The loans were not even managed well and lacked proper paperwork.Therefore, these investors sought a buyback relief in mortgages-backed securities that were offloaded by Countrywide Financial before it was acquired by BofA. The agreement closes a nine-month tussle between BofA and the investors.Our TakeThe acquisition of Countrywide substantially increased BofA's mortgage exposure compared to its peers. Following the collapse of the housing market, mortgage repurchases claim risk for the company grew manifold, a factor that has significantly drained the company's bottom line and its share price in the past.BofA even had to reach agreements of similar nature but of lesser amounts earlier this year with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as withAssured Guaranty Ltd.(AGO).We believe that such hefty payment, which represents the highest by a financial services company to date, definitely dents BofA's reputation in addition to its financials. Revenue headwinds and issues related to U.S. regulatory reform continue to restrict the company's earnings. Moreover, such settlements also deplete the company's capital position and therefore any dividend increase plan might be delayed.This settlement could also motivate other investors to ask for claims from mortgage lenders likeWells Fargo & Co.(WFC) andJPMorgan Chase & Co.(JPM) for their mortgage-backed securities tied to soured loans.Yet, we note that though this settlement does not put to rest BofA's mortgage issues, it removes a substantial uncertainty related to its potential mortgage repurchase liability. Reflecting this positive sentiment, BofA shares advanced nearly 3% on the NYSE yesterday.Shares of BofA currently have a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term ‘Hold' rating.ASSURED GUARNTY (AGO): Free Stock Analysis ReportBANK OF AMER CP (BAC): Free Stock Analysis ReportBANK OF NY MELL (BK): Free Stock Analysis ReportBLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportJPMORGAN CHASE (JPM): Free Stock Analysis ReportWELLS FARGO-NEW (WFC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

The company is said to be reaching an agreement to pay $8.5 billion to a group of investors who had suffered substantial losses for their investments in mortgage-backed securities sold by the company prior to the housing market failure, according to a Wall Street Journal report.The group of investors, including names such asBlackRock Inc.(BLK),MetLife Inc.(MET) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York alleged that prior to the financial crisis, Countrywide Financial Corp., a company that was acquired by BofA in 2008, had sold those securities that were tied to bad-quality loans.Neither the quality of the borrowers nor the collaterals matched the standards that Countrywide assured to the buyer of these securities. The loans were not even managed well and lacked proper paperwork. Therefore, these investors sought a buyback relief of $47 billion in mortgages backed securities that were offloaded by Countrywide Financial before it was acquired by BofA. The agreement, if reached, would close a nine-month fight between BofA and the investors.The acquisition of Countrywide substantially increased BofA's mortgage exposure. As a result, following the collapse of housing market, mortgage repurchases claim risk for the company has increased significantly. BofA reached agreements of similar nature but of lesser amounts earlier this year with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as withAssured Guaranty Ltd.(AGO).Such hefty payment, which represents the highest by a financial services company till date, would definitely dent BofA's financials and reputation.

Limited. Franklin is a global investment management organization operating as Franklin Templeton Investments.Melbourne-based Balanced Equity Management is a wholesale Australian Equity fund Manager, which initially focused on investing only in Australia's 50 largest companies on behalf of wholesale clients. In 2003, the firm extended its investment universe and included Australia's 100 largest companies. As of May 31, 2011, the firm managed about A$10.3 billion ($11.0 billion).Though financial terms have not been disclosed, the deal will be a cash and stock transaction. The acquisition is anticipated to be completed by early July 2011.Franklin's planned acquisition of Balanced Equity Management aims to mark its presence in the Australian market by providing best investment options for satisfying local investors' needs. The recognized Australian equity manager has over 20 years of experience in managing Australian equity strategies on behalf of large Australian superannuation and other institutional clients. Therefore, strategically the deal will be beneficial for Franklin as its investment options will be aided by local asset management expertise.Balanced Equity Management manages large cap Australian equity portfolios. It uses a fundamental value approach and internal bottom-up analysis giving effect to environmental, social and governance (ESG) terms coupled with after-tax benefits to its clients.Through this agreement, Balanced Equity Management looks forward to be a part of the well established Franklin. We expect the specialized investment strength of Balanced Equity Management in Australian equities to augur well for Franklin in the upcoming years. Moreover, the agreed upon transaction ensures long-term continuity for clients of equity manager in terms of investment team and process.Franklin's global footprint is an exceptionally favorable strategic point, since its AUM is well diversified. This coupled with a strong balance sheet and completion of recent acquisition is expected to cushion the company.However, the company is not immune to the volatile economic environment, which has been made worse by the costly regulatory environment. The regulatory restrictions could negatively impact the company's AUM while at the same time increasing its costs.Franklincurrently retains its Zacks #2 Rank, which translates into a short-term ‘Buy' rating. Moreover, considering the fundamentals, we maintain a long-term Outperform recommendation on the stock. Besides, Franklin's closest competitor –BlackRock Inc.(BLK), retains a Zacks #2 Rank (a short-term Buy rating).FRANKLIN RESOUR (BEN): Free Stock Analysis ReportBLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."
725,10444,BofA Eyes Divesting CCB Stake - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/06/1188816/bofa-eyes-divesting-ccb-stak,2011-06-21,BLK,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...On Monday,Bloombergreported thatBank of America Corporation(BAC) would sell a part of its holdings in China Construction Bank (CCB) later this year, in order to strengthen its capital. However, the company will continue to be a strategic investor in CCB, the world's second largest bank by value.As of March 31, 2011, BofA owned 25.6 billion shares of CCB worth $21 billion. This equaled a 10.6% stake in CCB's Hong Kong listed shares. Further, the lockup-period, wherein BofA is not allowed to sell its stake, would expire in August this year.According to Bloomberg data, BofA is the second biggest stake holder in CCB after the Chinese government, which holds 59%. CCB has 240.4 billion shares listed in Hong Kong and has 9.6 billion yuan-denominated shares in Shanghai.The potential buyers of BofA's stake could also include sovereign wealth funds. In 2005, BofA had paid $3 billion for a 9.9% stake in CCB, before CCB's IPO. The company further raised its stake by exercising the option to purchase an additional 11% for $9.2 billion.However, this is not the first time that BofA is planning to sell its stake in CCB. In January 2009, the company had sold 2.5% holdings in CCB, reaping a profit of $1.1 billion. Further, in May 2009, the company sold another 9.9% stake leading to a pre-tax profit of $7.3 billion. Also, in 2010, the company sold its right to buy another 1.79 billion shares in CCB to Temasek Holdings Pte, Singapore's state investment company.BofA's plan to sell a portion of its stake in CCB is a part of its long-term strategy to remove non-core assets from its balance sheet. The company also looks to concentrate more on businesses that directly serve customers, as well as fortify its balance sheet. The endeavor would aid the company to comply with new regulatory rules that are being imposed on various large U.S. banks to prevent another financial crisis.Earlier this month, BofA announced the completion of the spin-off of its last largest private equity (PE) fund, which has led to the creation of a new company named North Cove Partners. In the same month, BofA also completed the sale of its insurance subsidiary Balboa Insurance Company and affiliated entities to QBE Insurance Group. The company had inherited Balboa from Countrywide Financial, which it acquired in 2008.Furthermore, in 2010, BofA undertook several non-core asset shedding actions. Among others, in November, the company sold 43.6 million of itsBlackRock Inc.(BLK) shares and also sold an additional 2.5 million shares of BlackRock to Japan's third-biggest bank Mizuho Financial Group Inc. Also, in July 2010, BofA completed the sale ofFirst Republic Bank(FRC) for $1.86 billion to a group of investors led byColony Financial Inc.(CLNY) and General Atlantic LCC.With BofA's plan to boost dividend in the second half of 2011 being turned down by the Federal Reserve in March, the company will likely continue with its non-core asset shedding activities until its capital strength improves and balance sheet fortifies. Additionally, the company is also required to comply with regulatory provisions.Currently, BofA retains a Zacks # 5 Rank, which translates into a short-term ‘Strong Sell' rating. Also, considering the fundamentals, we maintain a long-term “Underperform” recommendation on the stock.Loading...Loading...BANK OF AMER CP (BAC): Free Stock Analysis ReportBLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportCOLONY FINL INC (CLNY): Free Stock Analysis ReportFIRST REP BK SF (FRC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

Fetting's total compensation, including a cash bonus, had been raised to $5.9 million in fiscal 2011. This represents a hike of 28% from $4.6 million received in prior fiscal year, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday.For fiscal 2011, Fetting's pay package includes salary of $500,000 unchanged from 2010, a cash bonus of $2.9 million (up from $950,000 in 2010) and stock awards of $1.9 million (up from $407,143 in 2010). He has also received stock options worth $625,000, declining from $2.7 million in 2010. There was other compensation including insurance premiums, totaling $21,272 in 2011.Legg Mason has raised the compensation of its CEO, following 24% year-over-year increase in net income to $253.9 million during fiscal 2011, driven by higher revenue.For fiscal 2011, Legg Mason recorded total revenue of $2.8 billion, up 6.0% year over year, reflecting higher advisory fee yield due to a more favorable asset mix and better performance fees, partially offset by decline in average AUM.As of March 31, 2011, Legg Mason's AUM was $677.6 billion, up 0.9% sequentially from $671.8 billion driven by market appreciation, partly offset by net outflows of $8.7 billion. On a year-over-year basis, AUM inched down 1.0% from $684.5 billion. Fixed income included 53% of consolidated AUM as of March 31, 2011, liquidity represented 19% and equity comprised 28%.Among the employees of Legg Mason, former Senior Executive and Vice President David R. Odenath, who joined the company in 2008 and resigned in December, received the highest pay package of $10.7 million.Increasing CEO package reflects Legg Mason's confidence with respect to its financials and future performance.We believe Legg Mason has the potential to outperform its peers in the long run, given its diversified product mix and leverage to the changing demographics in the market. However, in the near term, assets outflows will remain a significant headwind.Legg Mason currently retains its Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term ‘Hold' rating. Moreover, considering the fundamentals, we maintain a long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock. However, Legg Mason's closest competitor –BlackRock Inc.(BLK), retains a Zacks #1 Rank (a short-term Strong Buy rating).BLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportLEGG MASON INC (LM): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

However, the results compare favorably with earnings of 27 cents in the prior-year quarter.On a GAAP basis, earnings came in at 38 cents per share compared with 37 cents in the prior quarter and 21 cents in the year-ago quarter. GAAP results for the reported quarter included $24.2 million of transaction and integration charges.Invesco's earnings soared over the prior-year quarter primarily on an increase in net revenue as a result of inclusion of the retail asset management business ofMorgan Stanley(MS), partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Invesco had acquired Morgan Stanley's business division in the second quarter of 2010. The company's assets under management also continued to grow during the reported quarter.Quarter in DetailInvesco s adjusted net income decreased 8.4% from the prior quarter but surged by a whopping 60% from the prior year quarter to $191.7 million.Invesco's adjusted net revenue fell 1.3% sequentially but rose 38.1% year over year to $751.8 million. On a sequential basis, revenues plummeted primarily due to decreases in performance fees, which were partially offset by rise in investment management fees.Also, aided by favorable foreign exchange rate changes, net revenue increased $6.6 million from the prior quarter. Net revenue missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.1 billion.Adjusted investment management fees rose 2.1% sequentially and 32.1% year over year to $816.1 million. Service and distribution fees declined 1.6% sequentially but surged 76.6% year over year to $198.7 million.Adjusted operating expenses declined 0.4% sequentially but increased 32.7% year over year to $479.7 million. On a sequential basis, employee compensation expenses decreased 1.8% to $299.7 million primarily on reduced bonus expenses associated with performance fees.This was partly offset by rise in base salary, seasonally higher payroll taxes and higher severance costs. Marketing expenses moved up 3.7% from the prior quarter to $53.8 million.Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 36.2% compared with 36.8% in the prior quarter and 33.6% in the prior-year quarter.Assets under ManagementIncreased market value, as a result of the gradual recovery in global equity markets, improved assets under management (AUM) 4.1% sequentially and 40.2% year over year to $641.9 billion as of March 31, 2011. Average AUM for the reported quarter was $630.2 billion compared with $616.0 billion in the prior quarter and $449.6 billion in the prior-year quarter.Long-term net inflows were $6.6 billion compared with net outflows of $17.7 billion in the prior quarter and net inflows of $3.6 billion in the prior-year quarter. Money market net inflow was $2.6 billion as against net outflow of $1.6 billion in the prior quarter and net outflow of $10.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.Loading...Loading...Dividend UpdateConcurrent with the earnings release, the company declared a first quarter dividend of 12.25 cents per share, up 11.4% from 11 cents paid in the prior quarter. The dividend will be paid on June 8, 2011, to shareholders of record as of May 20, 2011.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, Invesco repurchased 2.1 million shares for $53.1 million, at an average price of $25.58.Peer PerformanceLast week, one of Invesco's peers,BlackRock Inc.(BLK) reported first quarter 2011 operating earnings of $2.96 per share, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.75. Better-than-expected results were primarily aided by strong top-line growth and improved equity markets, which were offset partially by higher operating expenses.While another peer,Franklin Resources Inc.(BEN) is scheduled to announce second quarter 2011 results on April 28.Our TakeImproving long-term investment performance propelled by a gradual recovery in the global equity market is expected to boost operating results over the mid to long term. Though rising operating expenses will remain near-term headwinds, significant improvement in operating leverage from Invesco's cost control initiatives is expected over the long term.The company is also poised to benefit from improved global investment flows due to its broad diversification. However, we remain concerned about increased redemptions and a volatile U.S. dollar.Invesco currently retains a Zacks # 3 Rank, which translates into a short-term ‘Hold' rating. Also, considering the fundamentals, we maintain our long-term “Neutral” recommendation on the stock.FRANKLIN RESOUR (BEN): Free Stock Analysis ReportBLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportINVESCO LTD (IVZ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMORGAN STANLEY (MS): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

Consequently, reported net income increased 24% year over year to $832 million.However, earnings per share of 66 cents in the first quarter 2010 included a reduction of 50 cents per share related to the redemption of TARP preferred shares.A substantial contraction in the provision for credit losses, lower non-interest expenses, a strong balance sheet and improved credit quality were attributed to the results. However, revenues were lower due to a challenging operating environment.Total revenue came in at $3.63 billion, down 3.5% from $3.76 billion in the prior-year quarter, while slightly exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.58 billion. The drop was due to lower net interest income.Net interest income for the reported quarter was $2.18 billion, down 1.1% sequentially and 8.5% year over year. Net interest margin climbed 1 basis point sequentially but dipped 30 basis points year-over-year to 3.94%. The decrease in net interest income and margin was attributed to lower purchase accounting accretion, continued soft loan demand and the low interest rate environment, which were partially offset by lower funding costs.Non-interest income decreased 14.5% sequentially, but edged up 5.1% year over year to $1.46 billion. In the reported quarter, non-interest income included a gain of $160 million on 7.5 millionBlackRock Inc.(BLK) shares sold by PNC Financial as part of BlackRock's secondary common stock offering.Additionally, the decline could be attributed to higher residential mortgage fees, higher net gains on sales of securities net of other-than-temporary impairments and a decrease in repurchase reserves partially offset by lower corporate service fees and a decline in service charges on deposits.Non-interest expense for the reported quarter decreased 11.5% sequentially and 2.0% year over year to $2.07 billion. The sequential decline was seen primarily due to disciplined expense management and elevated fourth quarter expense levels due to higher residential mortgage expenses principally related to foreclosure activities, the impact of integration costs and compensation-related costs.These declines were partially offset by a reversal of a portion of an indemnification liability for certainVisa Inc.(V) litigation of $38 million in the reported quarter, compared with $76 million in prior quarter as well as investments in the businesses. The year-over-year decline resulted from lower integration costs and reversal of a portion of an indemnification liability in the reported quarter partially offset by investments in the businesses.Credit quality significantly improved in the quarter. Non-performing assets decreased 20% year over year to $5.3 billion, mainly aided by lower commercial real estate non-performing loans and lower residential real estate non-performing loans. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets decreased 43 basis points year over year to 2.03%.Net charge-offs plunged $158 million year over year to $533 million in the reported quarter. The provision for credit losses during the quarter was $421 million, down 44% from $751 billion in the prior-year quarter, principally driven by overall credit quality improvement during 2010 and measures to reduce exposure levels. This reflects PNC Financial's return to a moderate risk profile.As of March 31, 2011, PNC's Tier 1 common capital ratio was an estimated 10.3%, up from 9.8% as on December 31, 2010 and 7.9% as on March 31, 2010.  The Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased to an estimated 12.6% from 12.1% at the end of the prior quarter and 10.3% at the end of the prior-year quarter. The increase in the ratios was primarily due to retention of earnings and lower risk-weighted assets.Total assets under administration increased to $219 billion at the end of the reported quarter from $212 billion at the end of prior quarter and $209 billion at the end of year-ago quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateOn April 7, 2011, the Board of PNC declared a 250% increase in quarterly cash dividend and its intention to buy back up to $500 million of common stock during the remainder of 2011, following the approval from Federal regulators under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program.Loading...Loading...The company will now pay a quarterly cash dividend of 35 cents per share on the common stock, up 25 cents per share from 10 cents paid in the prior quarter. The new dividend is payable on May 5, to shareholders of record as on April 18, 2011.The share buyback would take place under its existing 25 million share repurchase program in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Currently, the company has 24.7 million shares remaining. It has been in effect since October 4, 2007, and has no expiry date. Additionally, PNC's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on Series B, K and L preferred stock.

Consequently, reported net income increased 24% year over year to $832 million.However, earnings per share of 66 cents in the first quarter 2010 included a reduction of 50 cents per share related to the redemption of TARP preferred shares.A substantial contraction in the provision for credit losses, lower non-interest expenses, a strong balance sheet and improved credit quality were attributed to the results. However, revenues were lower due to a challenging operating environment.Total revenue came in at $3.63 billion, down 3.5% from $3.76 billion in the prior-year quarter, while slightly exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.58 billion. The drop was due to lower net interest income.Net interest income for the reported quarter was $2.18 billion, down 1.1% sequentially and 8.5% year over year. Net interest margin climbed 1 basis point sequentially but dipped 30 basis points year-over-year to 3.94%. The decrease in net interest income and margin was attributed to lower purchase accounting accretion, continued soft loan demand and the low interest rate environment, which were partially offset by lower funding costs.Non-interest income decreased 14.5% sequentially, but edged up 5.1% year over year to $1.46 billion. In the reported quarter, non-interest income included a gain of $160 million on 7.5 millionBlackRock Inc.(BLK) shares sold by PNC Financial as part of BlackRock's secondary common stock offering.Additionally, the decline could be attributed to higher residential mortgage fees, higher net gains on sales of securities net of other-than-temporary impairments and a decrease in repurchase reserves partially offset by lower corporate service fees and a decline in service charges on deposits.Non-interest expense for the reported quarter decreased 11.5% sequentially and 2.0% year over year to $2.07 billion. The sequential decline was seen primarily due to disciplined expense management and elevated fourth quarter expense levels due to higher residential mortgage expenses principally related to foreclosure activities, the impact of integration costs and compensation-related costs.These declines were partially offset by a reversal of a portion of an indemnification liability for certainVisa Inc.(V) litigation of $38 million in the reported quarter, compared with $76 million in prior quarter as well as investments in the businesses. The year-over-year decline resulted from lower integration costs and reversal of a portion of an indemnification liability in the reported quarter partially offset by investments in the businesses.Credit quality significantly improved in the quarter. Non-performing assets decreased 20% year over year to $5.3 billion, mainly aided by lower commercial real estate non-performing loans and lower residential real estate non-performing loans. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets decreased 43 basis points year over year to 2.03%.Net charge-offs plunged $158 million year over year to $533 million in the reported quarter. The provision for credit losses during the quarter was $421 million, down 44% from $751 billion in the prior-year quarter, principally driven by overall credit quality improvement during 2010 and measures to reduce exposure levels. This reflects PNC Financial's return to a moderate risk profile.As of March 31, 2011, PNC's Tier 1 common capital ratio was an estimated 10.3%, up from 9.8% as on December 31, 2010 and 7.9% as on March 31, 2010.  The Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased to an estimated 12.6% from 12.1% at the end of the prior quarter and 10.3% at the end of the prior-year quarter. The increase in the ratios was primarily due to retention of earnings and lower risk-weighted assets.Total assets under administration increased to $219 billion at the end of the reported quarter from $212 billion at the end of prior quarter and $209 billion at the end of year-ago quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateOn April 7, 2011, the Board of PNC declared a 250% increase in quarterly cash dividend and its intention to buy back up to $500 million of common stock during the remainder of 2011, following the approval from Federal regulators under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program.Loading...Loading...The company will now pay a quarterly cash dividend of 35 cents per share on the common stock, up 25 cents per share from 10 cents paid in the prior quarter. The new dividend is payable on May 5, to shareholders of record as on April 18, 2011.The share buyback would take place under its existing 25 million share repurchase program in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Currently, the company has 24.7 million shares remaining. It has been in effect since October 4, 2007, and has no expiry date. Additionally, PNC's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on Series B, K and L preferred stock. Its capital deployment efforts justify the company's capital strength and its commitment to return value to shareholders.BLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportPNC FINL SVC CP (PNC): Free Stock Analysis ReportVISA INC-A (V): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

This is a special-purpose investment vehicle that the company had handed over to FRBNY as collateral mortgage bonds during the peak of its financial crisis.The FRBNY has however decided to hold competitive bidding on the RMBS rather than handing them back to AIG. The bidding procedure is expected to help boost FRBNY's earnings. Moreover, given the improvement in the yield of the RMBS driven by the ongoing economic revival, many bidders are showing interest in this investment.For similar reasons, the buyback by AIG at this point would have proved to be a lucrative investment. Hence, the company's management is quite disappointed with FRBNY's decision. Nevertheless, beginning next week, FRBNY plans to sell these securities in blocks and pieces over time, wherebyBlackRock Inc.(BLK) is appointed to manage the sale process.Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported thatCredit Suisse AG(CS),Morgan Stanley(MS) andBarclays plc(BCS) are among the potentially interested bidders.Earlier this month, AIG had offered repurchase of about 800 RMBS at about 50 cents on the dollar. When AIG was formed in December 2008, it had about $20.5 billion of RMBS under Maiden II, which has now declined to $15.9 billion.The repurchase would have helped the US government to earn about $1.5 billion from the company's bailout loan. Additionally, the repayment of Maiden II loan could reduce AIG's loan obligations toward the US government to roughly $26 billion from $39 billion at 2010 end and the initial debt chunk of approximately $182 billion in 2008. This could have been quite an impressive progress.The government's $26 billion comprises preferred interests in AIA Group worth $11.3 billion held by the Treasury, a different Maiden Lane III vehicle that holds interests in collateralized debt obligations, and an undrawn line of credit. Besides, the debt repayment can help ease the process of public offering of 92% stake of Treasury in AIG, which is expected by May this year.Overall, uncertainty prevails on how successfully FRBNY will be able to unload this RMBS portfolio, where AIG has already set a bar of $15.7 billion, in an attempt to maximize its returns.AMER INTL GRP (AIG): Free Stock Analysis ReportBARCLAY PLC-ADR (BCS): Free Stock Analysis ReportBLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportCREDIT SUISSE (CS): Free Stock Analysis ReportMORGAN STANLEY (MS): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."
758,10479,Money Management Stocks Gaining Momentum - Investment Ideas,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/04/969120/money-management-stocks-gaini,2011-04-01,BLK,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...The big stock market rally of the last two years has been driven by massive capital inflows into equities. But a good portion of that volume has come on the back of large institutional players like hedge fund and pension managers that control big blocks of cash.But now, with the rally entering its third year, many retail investors are finally gaining the nerve to dip back into a market that saw steep losses in the financial crises of 2008 and 2009. That trend comes to light when taking a look at recent mutual fund inflows.Retail Investors Back in the GameIt kicked off with a very bullish January that saw inflows of $34 billion into equity and fixed-income funds, a very bullish signal that retail investors are looking to get back in the game. Since then, inflows into equity and fixed-income funds have been on a 10-week win streak, more evidence that retail investors are regaining their appetite for riskThat macro-level shift from a large group of investors represents a huge opportunity for money and asset managers, who get paid on both assets under management (AUM) and the actual performance of those assets.More Fuel in the Tank?And even though the bull is two years in the making, there is plenty of evidence to support more gains. The S&P500 is on the verge of regaining peak earnings from 2007 while trading at an 18% discount. That means the valuation picture is compelling, with the S&P 500 trading at a relatively cheap 14X forward earnings.So if retail investors are piling back into a wide basket of assets, it means money managers are well positioned to gain from the trend and increase their assets under management. Let's go ahead and take a look at our top picks in the category.Top 4 Investment Management StocksBlackstone Group LP(BX) is a private equity firm that specializes in private equity, real estate and debt with a market cap of $8.3 billion. Increased capital inflows and higher asset prices have been a boon for Blackstone, with this Zacks #2 rank stock recently hitting a new multi-year high. But the valuation picture is still in check, with a forward P/E of 12X. Take a look below.BlackRock, Inc.(BLK) is one of the largest asset managers in the world and has a market cap of $36 billion. This Zacks #2 rank stock has an average earnings surprise of 11% over the last three quarters and a bullish next-year estimate calling for 15% growth. And with a PEG ratio (PE/Growth) of 1, shares are trading at the traditional benchmark for value. Take a look at shares trading near the 52-week high below.Invesco Ltd(IVZ) is an asset manager that specializes in high net-worth and institutional investors with a market cap of $11.7 billion. This Zacks #2 rank stock recently hit a new multi-year high on an average earnings surprise of 8% over the last four quarters. With a bullish growth projection of 17% and compelling valuation, IVZ looks well positioned to benefit from additional capital inflows. Take a look at the chart below.Loading...Loading...Ameriprise Financial(AMP) has been a high flier for the last 6 months, recently topping off at a new multi-year high above $65. The investment services and management company is projected to grow earnings by 14% next year and has a discounted forward P/E of 11X, well below its peer average of 14X. Take a look at the chart below.The Take AwayThe strong equity rally of the last two years is driving capital inflows into investment services and management companies. And with the trend of strong corporate earnings well in play, these companies are well positioned to benefit from more gains.Michael Vodicka is the Momentum Stock Strategist for Zacks.com.

763,10484,T. Rowe Price Lowered to Neutral - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/03/956656/t-rowe-price-lowered-to-neutr,2011-03-28,BLK,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Based on rising operating expenses and regulatory headwinds, we have downgraded our recommendation onT. Rowe Price Group Inc.(TROW) to Neutral from Outperform.T. Rowe Price's fourth quarter 2010 earnings came in at 72 cents per share, significantly up from 57 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Higher-than-expected top-line growth and higher assets under management (AUM), partially offset by higher operating expenses, resulted in improved performance. The quarter's earnings also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents per share. As of December 31, 2010, the company repurchased 5 million shares of its common stock for $240 million.T. Rowe Price remains debt free with substantial liquidity that includes cash and mutual fund investment holdings. The company's sizeable internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities have helped it strengthen its capital leverage and generate substantially higher return on earnings than the industry average. These growth drivers also pave the way for an industry-leading dividend yield, thereby creating ample investor confidence and scope for investment as well as growth opportunities in the future.In February 2011, T. Rowe Price's board of directors approved a 15.0% hike in the company's quarterly common stock dividend. The revised quarterly dividend now stands at 31 cents per share compared with the previous amount of 27 cents per share. This marks T. Rowe's 25th consecutive annual dividend increase, reflecting the company's commitment toward returning value to shareholders with its strong cash generation capabilities.Despite the recent market downturn and the ongoing volatility, T. Rowe Price continues to outpace its peers in AUM growth through its disciplined and risk-aware investment approach. Besides, the company's lower fund cost structure, distribution methods, fund shareholder as well as administrative services help to promote stability in mutual fund AUM throughout the market cycles. While the resonance in the global markets will cause higher market valuations and increased income, the company will also be able to capitalize on the increasing savings and investment capacities of its customers.On the flip side, the financial services industry is already heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by new laws or amendments in any of the jurisdictions in which T. Rowe Price operates. Recently, governments in the U.S. and abroad have intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to the stresses experienced in the global financial markets. Any kind of stringent regulation could weigh heavily on the company's financials in the future.Furthermore, the company incurs significant expenditure to attract investment advisory clients and additional investments from existing clients. These efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that may be recognized from an AUM increase. Based on its current strategic projects and plans, T. Rowe Price has estimated 2011 capital expenditures to be nearly $120 million owing to property and equipment additions. These cash expenditures are expected to be funded by internal resources.Nevertheless, fundamentals remain strong with a debt-free position, higher return on earnings and improving investor sentiment. Relative mutual fund performance was also positive and we expect this to continue in the long run. T. Rowe Price's financial stability has the potential to take advantage of the improving economy and benefit from the growth opportunities in the domestic and global AUM. However, higher operating expenses and stringent regulatory norms could be causes of concern.T. Rowe Price currently retains a Zacks # 3 Rank, which translates into a short-term ‘Hold' rating. However, the company's closest competitor,BlackRock Inc.(BLK), retains a Zacks # 1 Rank, which translates into a short-term ‘Strong Buy' rating.BLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportT ROWE PRICE (TROW): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."
764,10485,Legg Mason Reiterated Neutral - Analyst Blog,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/03/953268/legg-mason-reiterated-neutral,2011-03-25,BLK,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...We maintain our Neutral recommendation onLegg Mason Inc.(LM) as third quarter fiscal 2011 (ended December 31) earnings fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher operating expenses and a decline in total assets under management (AUM) were the primary headwinds.In January, Legg Mason reported third-quarter fiscal 2011 earnings of 41 cents per share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. Results for the reported quarter included 10 cents per share in transition-related costs and 4 cents per share related to a closed-end fund launch.However, adjusted earnings, as reported by the company, came in at $110.3 million or 73 cents per share, up from earnings of $93.2 million or 57 cents per share in the comparable prior-year period. Results benefited partly from higher revenue.Legg Mason enjoys a strong operating and AUM leverage due to its diversified product mix and leading investment performance in both equity as well as fixed income markets. The company has consistently produced strong organic growth and is a best-in-class retail brokerage and asset management business. With an improvement in the equity markets and fixed income business, we expect the company's earnings to benefit. Additionally, aggressive expense control, multi-manager operating model, re-branding and restructuring product portfolio should provide downside support to margins in future.Legg Mason has been vigorously working on improving its operating efficiencies through its key initiatives that include offering of innovative product solutions to client base, tapping sound investment capacities and expanding distribution relationships. In May 2010, Legg Mason announced an initiative to streamline its business model and cut costs. The plan, which is scheduled to be completed in fiscal 2012, projects $130-$150 million in expense reductions.Also, Legg Mason remains committed to increasing shareholder wealth. The company is effectively deploying capital through share repurchase and has announced a $1 billion buyback authorization in May 2010. The company intends to use a portion of its available cash to purchase up to an additional $40 million of its common stock by the end of fiscal 2011 and continue repurchasing its stock in fiscal 2012. We expect such measures to instill confidence in the stock.On the flip side, Legg Mason's long-term funds (3–5 years) remain challenged due to decline in global asset values and volatile equity markets amid the current credit crunch. These factors significantly deteriorated the performance of Western Asset Management Company, which has an extensive business both within the U.S. and throughout the world. Further, asset outflows also remain a matter of concern for Legg Mason. The company experienced net client outflows in all asset classes in the third quarter of 2011. Considering the financial environment, which is still challenging, we believe that weakness in asset flows would remain a headwind in the near term.The current volatility in the financial markets and the government regulations pose the risk of interest rate fluctuation for the funds business of Legg Mason. While increases in interest rates may result in reduced prices in equity markets, any significant decrease will lead to outflows in fixed income and liquidity assets, where investors seek higher yields. These effects are anticipated to affect the AUM adversely and hinder the revenue and income growth of the company.However, we believe Legg Mason has the potential to outperform its peers in the long run, given its diversified product mix and leverage to the changing demographics in the market.Legg Mason currently retains its Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term ‘Hold' rating. However, Legg Mason's closest competitor –BlackRock Inc.(BLK) retains its Zacks #1 Rank, which translates into a short-term ‘Strong Buy' rating.BLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportLEGG MASON INC (LM): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

This Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) trades at just 14.8x forward estimates.BlackRock is a global investment management firm with assets under management (AUM), as of Dec 31, 2010, of $3.6 trillion. It offers mutual funds, the iShares ETFs and other pooled investment vehicles.The company also offers risk management and advisory services to institutional investors through BlackRock Solutions headquartered in New York.Raised the DividendOn Feb 24, BlackRock raised its dividend by 37.5 cents to $1.375 per share, an increase of 37.5% from the prior quarter.It was payable as of Mar 23 for shareholders of record at the close on Mar 7.The dividend currently yields 2.9% which is much higher than some of its peers such asFranklin Resources(BEN) which pays a yield of just 0.8%.BlackRock Beat for the 3rd Quarter in a RowOn Jan 25, BlackRock reported fourth quarter results which surprised on the Zacks Consensus by 17.9%. Earnings per share were $3.42 compared to the Zacks consensus of $2.90. It made just $2.39 in the fourth quarter of 2009.AUM rose 6% to $3.6 trillion from $3.3 trillion in the year ago quarter.On Dec 1, 2009, BlackRock acquired Barclay's, which included the iShares business. It has been handling merger related outflows since.The increase in the AUM for the year was driven from market and investment performance as well as $57.8 billion in net new business but merger-related outflows totaled $121 billion. The company believes the merger-related outflows are mostly behind it, leaving only some continuing technology implementation and organizational integration.Investors Came BackIn the fourth quarter, investors poured money into long-term products, pushing up net new business by $28.2 billion. Most of that went into equity and multi-asset class products. Fixed income business rose $9.4 billion.Index offerings, both through iShares and institutional accounts, brought in $13.4 billion and $12 billion, of net inflows respectively.Risk was seen differently around the globe as flows in EMEA and Asia-Pacific were primarily in fixed income products but investors in the Americas charged into equities and multi-asset class offerings.Zacks Consensus Estimates RiseLoading...Loading...Even though the company reported fourth quarter results nearly 2 months ago, the 2011 Zacks Consensus Estimate continues to rise.1 analyst revised the 2011 estimate higher in just the last 7 days, pushing the 2011 consensus up  by 2 cents to $12.47 per share.This is earnings growth of 14% over the $10.94 earned in 2009.Similarly, the 2012 Zacks Consensus Estimate has also moved higher by 2 cents to $14.34 per share but that was within the last month. Analysts expect another 15% earnings growth in 2012.BlackRock is expected to report first quarter 2011 results on Apr 25.BlackRock Is a Value StockIn addition to a P/E ratio under 15, which is my cut-off for a ""value"" stock, BlackRock also has a price-to-book ratio of 1.4. That is well below the P/B cut-off used for value stocks of 3.0.It is also below some of its peers, as Franklin Resources, for example, has a P/B ratio, of 3.2.Shares Near 3-Year HighWhile shares have rallied off the March 2009 lows and are near 3-year highs, they have yet to recoup the 2007 pre-recession highs.Check out the 5-year chart.Tracey Ryniec is the Value Stock Strategist for Zacks.com.

The hike was driven by impressive results in Asset Management and Advice & Wealth Management segments.For the full-year 2010, Ameriprise reported operating earnings of $4.47 per share, which also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.57 but was ahead of the previous year earnings of $3.08.The year-over-year results primarily benefited from increased asset-based fees as a result of market appreciation, higher client activity and the company's focus on high-performance advisors. Also, the company significantly benefited from the Columbia Management acquisition. However, higher expenses were the downside.Operating results exclude realized net investment gains/losses, non-recurring integration costs and impact of new accounting standards adopted in 2010.GAAP net income for the reported quarter came in at $305 million or $1.18 per share compared with $237 million or 90 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. For the full-year, net income amounted to $1.12 billion or $4.28 per share versus $722 million or $2.95 per share in 2009.Quarter in DetailOn an operating basis, Ameriprise's net revenues for the quarter rose 19% year over year to $2.63 billion. The improvement reflects growth in asset-based fees driven by the acquisition of Columbia Management, retail client net inflows and increased client activity levels. However, net revenues were lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72 billion.For the full-year, Ameriprise's operating revenues came in at $9.58 billion, 24% ahead of $7.73 billion reported in 2009, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.97 billion.GAAP expenses in the quarter climbed 19.3% year over year to $2.31 billion, and operating expenses escalated 16.7% from the year-ago quarter to $2.23 billion. These reflect a significant increase in distribution expenses along with benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.Asset PositionOwned, managed and administered assets increased 47% year over year to $673 billion as of December 31, 2010. The increase followed from the acquisition of Columbia Management, retail client net inflows and market appreciation.Loading...Loading...CapitalAmeriprise continues to maintain strong liquidity with nearly $1.5 billion in excess capital, which we believe, will help it grow through acquisitions.As of December 31, 2010, the debt-to-total capital ratio attributable to Ameriprise Financial was 17.7%. However, the debt-to-total-capital ratio, excluding non-recourse debt, the impact of consolidated investment entities and the 75% equity credit for hybrid securities, was 16.2%.Share RepurchaseDuring the quarter, Ameriprise repurchased 3.8 million shares of its common stock for $200 million.  For the full-year, the company repurchased 13.1 million shares of its common stock for $573 million.Dividend UpdateConcurrent with the earnings release, the board of Ameriprise declared a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per share. The dividend will be paid on February 25, 2011, to shareholders of record as on February 11, 2011.Peer PerformanceLast week Ameriprise's close competitor –BlackRock Inc.(BLK) had reported fourth quarter 2010 operating earnings of $3.42 per share, which were substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.90, and were primarily aided by strong growth in top line, benefits of the BGI acquisition and improved equity markets, which were offset partially by higher operating expenses.For the full-year, the company had reported operating earnings of $10.94 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.39.Our TakeThough there is concern over sluggish market recovery, improvement in retail client activity and decent growth in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses will drive operating leverage in the upcoming quarters. We also expect the acquisition of Columbia Management to provide far-reaching product distribution opportunities.Ameriprise currently retains a Zacks #1 Rank, which translates into a short-term “Strong Buy” rating. Also, considering the fundamentals, we maintain our long-term “Outperform” recommendation on the stock.AMERIPRISE FINL (AMP): Free Stock Analysis ReportBLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

It was observed that patients with severe refractory asthma, when treated with Alair bronchial thermoplasty (BT) system, experienced stability in lung function without clinical complications over a five-year period.Long-term safety data from the RISA trial also concurred with another five-year data from the Asthma Intervention Research (AIR) study. The AIR trial comparing BT with the standard of care, for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma, also condoned the long-term safety profile of the BT system.Moreover, findings from the Asthma Intervention Research 2 (AIR2) trial show persistence of safety and effectiveness of BT after two years. Besides, results from AIR2 trial at one year also demonstrated positive outcome with respect to reduction in asthma attacks (by 32%), emergency room visits for respiratory symptoms (84%) and days lost from work (66%).Alair was inducted in Boston Scientific's portfolio with its acquisition of Asthmatx in October 2010. The Alair BT system provides long lasting and improved asthma control for adult patients suffering from severe asthma who have not benefited from current inhaled medications.Alair has been approved in both Europe and the US and is the first device-based asthma treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Alair has been available in the UK since June 2011 and in other European countries since September 2011.Asthma is one of the most common ailments in the world which involves a costly treatment process and afflicts more than 30 million people in Europe and 300 million globally. About 20% of European patients with severe asthma cannot control their symptoms with drugs. We believe recent favorable data from Alair BT should lead to better acceptance of the product going ahead.RecommendationBoston Scientific presented all-round growth during the most recent quarter, exceeding its own guidance, despite the lingering challenges in its core CRM business.The company is leaving no stone unturned to keep the company on the growth track. These include technological developments through acquisitions, restructuring program, debt reduction and a new $1 billion share repurchase program. However, the company faces stiff competition from players such asMedtronic(MDT) andSt Jude Medical(STJ) among others.We currently have an Outperform recommendation on the stock, which also corresponds with the Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) in the short term. Both Medtronic and St Jude Medical carry Zacks #3 Ranks (Hold) along with Neutral recommendations.BOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

Although a number of these issues are expected to linger over the second-half of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The highly-regulated medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest-growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies, given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling health care costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.An increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from healthc are reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011.Recently, in a bid to curb the nation's bloated budget deficit, the Obama administration has passed a bill which includes plans to cut health care expenditure. Under the bill, a 12-person bipartisan panel was created to recommend a sharp reduction in spending on government programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Medicare and Medicaid, which account for about 20% of the federal budget, represent a key target of the deficit-reduction plan. The bill aims to cut $2.4 trillion in federal government spending over the next decade.Federal budgetary pressure (given a potential reduction in U.S. government's health care spending) has raised reimbursement risk as payors may more actively pursue their cost reduction initiatives. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical devices companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – Changes on the Horizon?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices (to include devices such as infusion pumps) under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies. President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.In a shocking move, in late July 2011, the IOM recommended the FDA scrap the 510(k) process and replace it with a new regulatory framework that integrates pre-market clearance and better post-market surveillance. The IOM review concluded that the 510(k) process fails to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class II devices before they enter the market. The recommendation was met with immediate industry-wide criticism.However, the FDA noted that the IOM's recommendation is not binding and the 510(k) process should not be eliminated. The regulator is currently seeking public feedback on the proposal (a meeting scheduled in mid-September 2011) with plans in place to decide on potential changes in late September/early October 2011.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still-soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.Loading...Loading...These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro and radiation oncology products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD) andVarian Medical(VAR).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space.Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: A Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a spate of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well-positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies have a number of levers to pull and represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed weakness in its ICD business in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market. The company saw all-round growth during the second quarter, outstripping its own guidance, although the CRM segment remains challenging. After several quarters, growth in the Cardiovascular portfolio came as a pleasant surprise. Based on a strong quarter, the company raised its guidance for 2011. We recently upgraded the stock to Outperform.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify devices are already gaining notable traction.Several new products (including the quadripolar CRT-D systems) should boost the company's CRM share in 2011, despite the weak market conditions. However, we do account for the fact that approval of the highly-anticipated quadripolar CRT-D, has been pushed back to early fourth-quarter 2011 from mid-2011.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the second quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Apart from heart valve therapy, healthy growth at the critical care segment (led by Flotrac systems and pressure monitoring products) is also encouraging.Moreover, Edwards's robust balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Following the favorable recommendation of the FDA Advisory Panel for Sapien THV (for inoperable patients), the company is confident of receiving final approval by October 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.Another value proposition is robotic surgical systems makerIntuitive Surgical(ISRG). Intuitive's recurring revenue stream continues to grow and provides a shield against cyclicality of revenues, arising from the sale of discretionary capital equipment to hospitals. We believe that its da Vinci surgery system has the capacity to improve outcomes and cut down on procedure time.We expect a number of procedures that are currently completed either in an open surgical manner or with laparoscopy to be eventually replaced by da Vinci surgery, as robotic surgery becomes the standard of care in many instances. The company enjoys a virtual monopoly in robotic surgery with little competition. Intuitive expects total procedure count to increase in the band of 27%-29% year over year in fiscal 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools. Moreover, the company is also buying Sweden-based blood test systems maker Phadia for $3.5 billion.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage(LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude has registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. The company expects to commence the European clinical trial of Portico valve in late 2011 (launch expected by first-half 2013). Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for companies such asVolcano Corp.(VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession.However, results from the first two quarters of 2011 indicate a silver lining stemming from continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. A healthy replacement/upgrade cycle may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESImpact of Japan DebacleThe impact of the horrific March 11 earthquake in Japan and its aftermath has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products.Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region. U.S. medical devices firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.Medtronic,Boston ScientificandJohnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis, which is hard to gauge at this moment.A Still Clouded Orthopedic OutlookWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. The reconstructive market fundamentals (pricing and volume) remains challenging with little or no clear visibility for a material turnaround in second-half 2011.Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). We remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine Continues to HurtThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their results for the first two quarters of 2011.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market through 2011. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilizing but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy and reimbursement-related pushback.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe.The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010. Volume headwind is likely to sustain through the back half of 2011 as unemployment continues to influence procedure deferrals.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Most of the leading players in the orthopedic space reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter, echoing a general softness in the market.June quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although stabilized sequentially) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportINTUITIVE SURG (ISRG): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportTHERMO FISHER (TMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportVOLCANO CORP (VOLC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."
955,12174,Medical Devices Stock Outlook - Sept. 2011 - Zacks Analyst Interviews,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/09/1905471/medical-devices-stock-outloo,2011-09-07,BSX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...June quarter results mostly mirror the preceding quarter as a host of macro headwinds (including price and procedure volume pressures) continued to haunt the MedTech industry and weighed on the performance of the incumbent players. Although a number of these issues are expected to linger over the second-half of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The highly-regulated medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest-growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies, given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling health care costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.An increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from healthc are reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011.Recently, in a bid to curb the nation's bloated budget deficit, the Obama administration has passed a bill which includes plans to cut health care expenditure. Under the bill, a 12-person bipartisan panel was created to recommend a sharp reduction in spending on government programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Medicare and Medicaid, which account for about 20% of the federal budget, represent a key target of the deficit-reduction plan. The bill aims to cut $2.4 trillion in federal government spending over the next decade.Federal budgetary pressure (given a potential reduction in U.S. government's health care spending) has raised reimbursement risk as payors may more actively pursue their cost reduction initiatives. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical devices companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – Changes on the Horizon?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices (to include devices such as infusion pumps) under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies. President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.In a shocking move, in late July 2011, the IOM recommended the FDA scrap the 510(k) process and replace it with a new regulatory framework that integrates pre-market clearance and better post-market surveillance. The IOM review concluded that the 510(k) process fails to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class II devices before they enter the market. The recommendation was met with immediate industry-wide criticism.However, the FDA noted that the IOM's recommendation is not binding and the 510(k) process should not be eliminated. The regulator is currently seeking public feedback on the proposal (a meeting scheduled in mid-September 2011) with plans in place to decide on potential changes in late September/early October 2011.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still-soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.Loading...Loading...These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro and radiation oncology products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD) andVarian Medical(VAR).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space.Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: A Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a spate of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well-positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies have a number of levers to pull and represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed weakness in its ICD business in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market. The company saw all-round growth during the second quarter, outstripping its own guidance, although the CRM segment remains challenging. After several quarters, growth in the Cardiovascular portfolio came as a pleasant surprise. Based on a strong quarter, the company raised its guidance for 2011. We recently upgraded the stock to Outperform.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify devices are already gaining notable traction.Several new products (including the quadripolar CRT-D systems) should boost the company's CRM share in 2011, despite the weak market conditions. However, we do account for the fact that approval of the highly-anticipated quadripolar CRT-D, has been pushed back to early fourth-quarter 2011 from mid-2011.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the second quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Apart from heart valve therapy, healthy growth at the critical care segment (led by Flotrac systems and pressure monitoring products) is also encouraging.Moreover, Edwards's robust balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Following the favorable recommendation of the FDA Advisory Panel for Sapien THV (for inoperable patients), the company is confident of receiving final approval by October 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.Another value proposition is robotic surgical systems makerIntuitive Surgical(ISRG). Intuitive's recurring revenue stream continues to grow and provides a shield against cyclicality of revenues, arising from the sale of discretionary capital equipment to hospitals. We believe that its da Vinci surgery system has the capacity to improve outcomes and cut down on procedure time.We expect a number of procedures that are currently completed either in an open surgical manner or with laparoscopy to be eventually replaced by da Vinci surgery, as robotic surgery becomes the standard of care in many instances. The company enjoys a virtual monopoly in robotic surgery with little competition. Intuitive expects total procedure count to increase in the band of 27%-29% year over year in fiscal 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools. Moreover, the company is also buying Sweden-based blood test systems maker Phadia for $3.5 billion.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage(LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude has registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. The company expects to commence the European clinical trial of Portico valve in late 2011 (launch expected by first-half 2013). Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for companies such asVolcano Corp.(VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession.However, results from the first two quarters of 2011 indicate a silver lining stemming from continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment.

Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies. President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.In a shocking move, in late July 2011, the IOM recommended the FDA scrap the 510(k) process and replace it with a new regulatory framework that integrates pre-market clearance and better post-market surveillance. The IOM review concluded that the 510(k) process fails to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class II devices before they enter the market. The recommendation was met with immediate industry-wide criticism.However, the FDA noted that the IOM's recommendation is not binding and the 510(k) process should not be eliminated. The regulator is currently seeking public feedback on the proposal (a meeting scheduled in mid-September 2011) with plans in place to decide on potential changes in late September/early October 2011.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still-soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.Loading...Loading...These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro and radiation oncology products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD) andVarian Medical(VAR).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space.Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: A Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a spate of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well-positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies have a number of levers to pull and represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed weakness in its ICD business in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market. The company saw all-round growth during the second quarter, outstripping its own guidance, although the CRM segment remains challenging. After several quarters, growth in the Cardiovascular portfolio came as a pleasant surprise. Based on a strong quarter, the company raised its guidance for 2011. We recently upgraded the stock to Outperform.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify devices are already gaining notable traction.Several new products (including the quadripolar CRT-D systems) should boost the company's CRM share in 2011, despite the weak market conditions. However, we do account for the fact that approval of the highly-anticipated quadripolar CRT-D, has been pushed back to early fourth-quarter 2011 from mid-2011.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the second quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Apart from heart valve therapy, healthy growth at the critical care segment (led by Flotrac systems and pressure monitoring products) is also encouraging.Moreover, Edwards's robust balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Following the favorable recommendation of the FDA Advisory Panel for Sapien THV (for inoperable patients), the company is confident of receiving final approval by October 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.Another value proposition is robotic surgical systems makerIntuitive Surgical(ISRG). Intuitive's recurring revenue stream continues to grow and provides a shield against cyclicality of revenues, arising from the sale of discretionary capital equipment to hospitals. We believe that its da Vinci surgery system has the capacity to improve outcomes and cut down on procedure time.We expect a number of procedures that are currently completed either in an open surgical manner or with laparoscopy to be eventually replaced by da Vinci surgery, as robotic surgery becomes the standard of care in many instances. The company enjoys a virtual monopoly in robotic surgery with little competition. Intuitive expects total procedure count to increase in the band of 27%-29% year over year in fiscal 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools. Moreover, the company is also buying Sweden-based blood test systems maker Phadia for $3.5 billion.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage(LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude has registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. The company expects to commence the European clinical trial of Portico valve in late 2011 (launch expected by first-half 2013). Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for companies such asVolcano Corp.(VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession.However, results from the first two quarters of 2011 indicate a silver lining stemming from continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. A healthy replacement/upgrade cycle may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESImpact of Japan DebacleThe impact of the horrific March 11 earthquake in Japan and its aftermath has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products.Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region. U.S. medical devices firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.Medtronic,Boston ScientificandJohnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis, which is hard to gauge at this moment.A Still Clouded Orthopedic OutlookWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. The reconstructive market fundamentals (pricing and volume) remains challenging with little or no clear visibility for a material turnaround in second-half 2011.Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). We remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine Continues to HurtThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their results for the first two quarters of 2011.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market through 2011. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilizing but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy and reimbursement-related pushback.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe.The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010. Volume headwind is likely to sustain through the back half of 2011 as unemployment continues to influence procedure deferrals.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Most of the leading players in the orthopedic space reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter, echoing a general softness in the market.June quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although stabilized sequentially) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportINTUITIVE SURG (ISRG): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportTHERMO FISHER (TMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportVOLCANO CORP (VOLC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

Although a number of these issues are expected to linger through the remainder of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling healthcare costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.Increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from the healthcare reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical device companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – More Stringent RegulationThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator has shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies.President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine, which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.The FDA plans to implement its new set of plans through a process of regulatory actions such as draft guidance and proposed regulations, which will be open to public feedback. CDRH stated that it will wait for the pending review report of the Institute of Medicine before making a final decision.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.Loading...Loading...OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro, radiation oncology and blood-related products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD),Varian Medical(VAR) andHaemonetics Corporation(HAE).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space in the wake of recovery.In addition, low global penetration and robust demand provides a positive long-term thesis for investing in the blood processing industry. Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a slew of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed slower market growth of ICD in the U.S. in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.We believe that the recently approved REVO MRI SureScan pacemaker and Arctic Front catheter should provide some support to Medtronic's CRM business. REVO is already gaining positive initial market acceptance and is expected to be key growth drivers going ahead. The company's struggling spinal franchise should also benefit gradually from the recent product launches.Moreover, Medtronic plans to adopt restructuring initiatives (including workforce reduction) to sustain long-term growth. The company is also blessed with strong cash flows which it prudently uses for maximizing shareholder value. Medtronic is active on the acquisition front and is investing in emerging markets, which it considers an increasingly important growth driver.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership position in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market with 46% share in the U.S. market. The launch of Taxus Element stent (commercialized as Ion) in the U.S. in April 2011 strongly places the company to gain DES share. Moreover, its pipeline DES product Promus Element (expected launch in the U.S. in mid-2012) is shaping up to be a major driver of its stent business. Besides, the acquisition of asthma-treatment company Asthmatx has enabled Boston Scientic to target the pulmonary devices area.Boston Scientific has undertaken a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives that are expected to contribute to the bottom line moving forward. The company plans to expand its footprint in the emerging markets by reinvesting the savings from restructuring efforts. In this context, we reckon the company's divestiture of its Neurovascular business as a smart move, enabling it to prepay a portion of the debt and invest in high growth markets.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify lines of ICDs are already gaining notable traction. Moreover, launch of several products (including the quadripolar CRT systems) should boost the company's CRM market share in 2011.The recent European clearance of the Accent MRI pacemaker and the approval ShockGuard technology, designed for use with the Fortify and Unify systems, represents an incremental positive for the company. Another encouraging prospect is St. Jude's April 2011 pact with health care supply contracting company Novation. Under the deal, Novation will make the company's CRM products available to some of the leading academic centers in the U.S. This should broaden the use of St. Jude's products and technologies and boost its market share.Moreover, the recent U.S. approval of two new irrigated ablation catheters (Safire BLU and Therapy Cool Path) for treating cardiac arrhythmias should help St. Jude sustain the healthy growth in Atrial Fibrillation through 2011.Trifecta, which was launched in Europe in fourth-quarter 2010 and was recently approved in the U.S., represents a major new driver for the company's Cardiovascular franchise. St. Jude's tissue valve business in Europe is growing more than 30% rate and the company expects similar growth in the U.S.We are also optimistic about the emerging opportunity in the intravascular imaging market, enabled by the company's LightLab acquisition in July 2010. Moreover, its $1.3 billion acquisition of heart devices maker AGA Medical Holdings will eventually make St. Jude a clear leader in the structural heart market. The company expects the acquisition to help its sales grow at a low double-digit rate in 2011.However, we do acknowledge the fact that a soft CRM market may be a drag on these stocks. The prevailing macroeconomic factors, pricing pressure, austerity measures and the impact of health care reform are expected to continue to weigh on the CRM market through 2011. Data for the U.S. defibrillators market, published in the first-quarter 2011, indicate deterioration in the defibrillator market growth rate, including the pricing impact.The CRM market also faces a number of challenges including physician reaction to recent study results published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (“JAMA”) regarding evidence-based guidelines for ICD implants and the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation into hospitals' ICD implants.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the first quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Moreover, Edwards's strong balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Importantly, its Sapien transcatheter heart valve is slated for review by the FDA Advisory Panel on July 20, 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth. Based on an upbeat Impella outlook, Abiomed recently issued a solid revenue guidance.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its coveted RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude recently registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for the incumbent players such as Volcano Corp. (VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for the MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession. However, first quarter results indicate continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. This may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESJapan Debacle: Greater Impact Looms?The impact of the March 11 earthquake (and Tsunami) in Japan and its aftermath on the medical devices industry appears to be substantial. Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region.The roughly $25 billion Japanese medical devices sector has been an extremely successful market for American medical devices firms. U.S. firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.MedTech majors such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific andJohnson & Johnson's(JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.The impact of the horrific disaster is being already felt as it has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products. The negative impact of the Japan crisis on MedTech companies with high exposure is expected to become more pronounced in the June quarter.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis (as reflected in falling share prices), which is hard to gauge at this moment.Softness in Orthopedic LingersWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). While most of these names beat expectations in the first quarter we remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes Here to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine: Still HurtsThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their March quarter results.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market over the next few quarters. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilized but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe . The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Both these companies reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter. A general sluggishness in procedure volume continues to impinge on the results of the leading players in the orthopedic market.March quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although manifesting some signs of sequential stabilization) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCONMED CORP (CNMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportHAEMONETICS CP (HAE): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportSPRINT NEXTEL (S): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportWRIGHT MEDICAL (WMGI): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator has shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies.President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine, which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.The FDA plans to implement its new set of plans through a process of regulatory actions such as draft guidance and proposed regulations, which will be open to public feedback. CDRH stated that it will wait for the pending review report of the Institute of Medicine before making a final decision.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.Loading...Loading...OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro, radiation oncology and blood-related products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD),Varian Medical(VAR) andHaemonetics Corporation(HAE).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space in the wake of recovery.In addition, low global penetration and robust demand provides a positive long-term thesis for investing in the blood processing industry. Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a slew of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed slower market growth of ICD in the U.S. in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.We believe that the recently approved REVO MRI SureScan pacemaker and Arctic Front catheter should provide some support to Medtronic's CRM business. REVO is already gaining positive initial market acceptance and is expected to be key growth drivers going ahead. The company's struggling spinal franchise should also benefit gradually from the recent product launches.Moreover, Medtronic plans to adopt restructuring initiatives (including workforce reduction) to sustain long-term growth. The company is also blessed with strong cash flows which it prudently uses for maximizing shareholder value. Medtronic is active on the acquisition front and is investing in emerging markets, which it considers an increasingly important growth driver.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership position in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market with 46% share in the U.S. market. The launch of Taxus Element stent (commercialized as Ion) in the U.S. in April 2011 strongly places the company to gain DES share. Moreover, its pipeline DES product Promus Element (expected launch in the U.S. in mid-2012) is shaping up to be a major driver of its stent business. Besides, the acquisition of asthma-treatment company Asthmatx has enabled Boston Scientic to target the pulmonary devices area.Boston Scientific has undertaken a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives that are expected to contribute to the bottom line moving forward. The company plans to expand its footprint in the emerging markets by reinvesting the savings from restructuring efforts. In this context, we reckon the company's divestiture of its Neurovascular business as a smart move, enabling it to prepay a portion of the debt and invest in high growth markets.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify lines of ICDs are already gaining notable traction. Moreover, launch of several products (including the quadripolar CRT systems) should boost the company's CRM market share in 2011.The recent European clearance of the Accent MRI pacemaker and the approval ShockGuard technology, designed for use with the Fortify and Unify systems, represents an incremental positive for the company. Another encouraging prospect is St. Jude's April 2011 pact with health care supply contracting company Novation. Under the deal, Novation will make the company's CRM products available to some of the leading academic centers in the U.S. This should broaden the use of St. Jude's products and technologies and boost its market share.Moreover, the recent U.S. approval of two new irrigated ablation catheters (Safire BLU and Therapy Cool Path) for treating cardiac arrhythmias should help St. Jude sustain the healthy growth in Atrial Fibrillation through 2011.Trifecta, which was launched in Europe in fourth-quarter 2010 and was recently approved in the U.S., represents a major new driver for the company's Cardiovascular franchise. St. Jude's tissue valve business in Europe is growing more than 30% rate and the company expects similar growth in the U.S.We are also optimistic about the emerging opportunity in the intravascular imaging market, enabled by the company's LightLab acquisition in July 2010. Moreover, its $1.3 billion acquisition of heart devices maker AGA Medical Holdings will eventually make St. Jude a clear leader in the structural heart market. The company expects the acquisition to help its sales grow at a low double-digit rate in 2011.However, we do acknowledge the fact that a soft CRM market may be a drag on these stocks. The prevailing macroeconomic factors, pricing pressure, austerity measures and the impact of health care reform are expected to continue to weigh on the CRM market through 2011. Data for the U.S. defibrillators market, published in the first-quarter 2011, indicate deterioration in the defibrillator market growth rate, including the pricing impact.The CRM market also faces a number of challenges including physician reaction to recent study results published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (“JAMA”) regarding evidence-based guidelines for ICD implants and the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation into hospitals' ICD implants.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the first quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Moreover, Edwards's strong balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Importantly, its Sapien transcatheter heart valve is slated for review by the FDA Advisory Panel on July 20, 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth. Based on an upbeat Impella outlook, Abiomed recently issued a solid revenue guidance.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its coveted RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude recently registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for the incumbent players such as Volcano Corp. (VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for the MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession. However, first quarter results indicate continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. This may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESJapan Debacle: Greater Impact Looms?The impact of the March 11 earthquake (and Tsunami) in Japan and its aftermath on the medical devices industry appears to be substantial. Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region.The roughly $25 billion Japanese medical devices sector has been an extremely successful market for American medical devices firms. U.S. firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.MedTech majors such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific andJohnson & Johnson's(JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.The impact of the horrific disaster is being already felt as it has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products. The negative impact of the Japan crisis on MedTech companies with high exposure is expected to become more pronounced in the June quarter.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis (as reflected in falling share prices), which is hard to gauge at this moment.Softness in Orthopedic LingersWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). While most of these names beat expectations in the first quarter we remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes Here to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine: Still HurtsThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their March quarter results.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market over the next few quarters. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilized but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe . The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Both these companies reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter. A general sluggishness in procedure volume continues to impinge on the results of the leading players in the orthopedic market.March quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although manifesting some signs of sequential stabilization) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCONMED CORP (CNMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportHAEMONETICS CP (HAE): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportSPRINT NEXTEL (S): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportWRIGHT MEDICAL (WMGI): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

1083,12302,Medical Devices Industry Outlook – April 2011 - Industry Outlook,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/03/968548/medical-devices-industry-outl,2011-03-31,BSX,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...Last year was challenging for medical device companies given the exigent economic conditions and an uncertain healthcare environment. The MedTech industry was hit by several macro headwinds in 2010 including price/volume and utilization pressure and a more restrictive regulatory environment. Although a number of these issues remain, the industry is expected to fare better this year due to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest medical devices market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The medical devices industry is divided into different segments such as Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic, Aesthetic Devices and Healthcare IT (“HCIT”). The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, thanks to an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic represent the fastest growing categories.The MedTech industry faced a host of issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks. While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product launches, an aging population, geographic expansion and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.With several growth constraints in the legacy markets, medical device companies are aiming to expand into lucrative new markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies may hit their bottom lines. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling healthcare costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.Increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from the healthcare reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical device companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.Regulatory Landscape - The 510(k) ReformThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, on August 3, 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan on January 19, 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator has shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies. President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine, which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review with feedback expected in mid-2011. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.The FDA plans to implement its new set of plans through a process of regulatory actions such as draft guidance and proposed regulations, which will be open to public feedback. CDRH stated that it will wait for the pending review report of the Institute of Medicine before making a final decision. Moreover, the regulator is planning for a public meeting in April 2011 to seek feedback on two other issues.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still struggling economy, top-tier devices makers are expected to continue their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in delivering operational synergies from these acquisitions, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions.OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, Neuro, radiation oncology and blood-related products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific CorporationLoading...Loading...(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(AMBD),Cyberonics Inc.(CYBX),Varian Medical(VAR),Accuray Incorporated(ARAY),Haemonetics Corporation(HAE).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and procedure growth headwinds) in the cardiovascular space in the wake of recovery. In addition, low global penetration and robust demand provides a positive long-term thesis for investing in the blood processing industry. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: Long-Term WinnersWith a slew of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment. However, we do acknowledge the fact that a soft CRM market may be a drag on these stocks. The prevailing macroeconomic factors, pricing pressure, austerity measures and the impact of health care reform are expected to continue to weigh on the CRM market through 2011.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in Cardiovascular, Neuro, Spinal, Diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company lost some U.S. ICD market share in the most recent quarter due to competition, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device. While Protecta ICD has yet to be cleared in the U.S., it continues to perform very well in Europe.We believe that the recent approval of the REVO MRI SureScan pacemaker and Arctic Front catheter should provide some support to Medtronic's CRM business. Its spinal segment should also benefit gradually from the recent product launches.Moreover, Medtronic plans to adopt restructuring initiatives (including workforce reduction) to sustain long-term growth. The company is also blessed with strong cash flows which it prudently uses for maximizing shareholder value. Medtronic is active on the acquisition front and is investing in emerging markets, which it considers an increasingly important growth driver.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership position in the global drug eluting stent (“DES”) market with 35% share (46% in the US market). Importantly, its pipeline DES product Promus Element is shaping up to be a major driver of its stent business. Moreover, we are also encouraged by Boston Scientic's acquisition of asthma-treatment company Asthmatx, which will enable it to target the pulmonary devices area.Boston Scientific has undertaken a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives that are expected to contribute to the bottom line moving forward. The company plans to expand its footprint in the emerging markets by reinvesting the savings from restructuring efforts. In this context, we reckon the company's divestiture of its Neurovascular business as a smart move, enabling it to prepay a portion of the debt and invest in high growth markets.St. Jude is poised to grow its market share in the CRM segment (especially in ICDs), driven by its new Fortify and Unify lines of devices. Launch of several products (including the quadripolar CRT systems) in the U.S. and Europe should boost the company's CRM market share in 2011. Moreover, we are optimistic about the emerging opportunity in the intravascular imaging market, enabled by the company's LightLab acquisition in July 2010.St. Jude's EnSite mapping system for diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmia continues to be the key driving force in atrial fibrillation. Also, its $1.3 billion acquisition of heart devices maker AGA Medical Holdings will eventually make St. Jude a clear leader in the structural heart market. The company expects the acquisition to help its sales grow at a low double-digit rate in 2011.Beyond the MedTech giants, an interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements.We also believe that cardiac assist devices-maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth. Based on healthy Impella demand trend, Abiomed has raised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2011.We are also optimistic about companies in the radiation oncology market such as Varian and Accuray. The radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements which are expected to boost the performance of these companies in 2011.Accuray is a global leader in the field of radiosurgery and continues to enjoy healthy demand for its CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery systems as evidenced by sustained growth in the number of patients receiving treatment with the device. Notably, the company's acquisition of its rivalTomoTherapy(TOMO) will reinforce its foothold in the radiation oncology space.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its coveted RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.Emerging Markets: An Opportunity to DiversifyThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets. Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for the incumbent players such asVolcano Corp.(VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit rate over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Hospital Spending: A Potential Tailwind?A soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for the MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession. However, recent quarterly results indicate signs of recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. This may turn into a potential driver moving forward.Federal “Stimulus”: A Boon for HCITsAnother area which is interestingly poised for growth these days is Healthcare IT. The landscape has changed since the Obama Administration took initiatives to encourage hospitals and physicians to modernize their health record-keeping as part of the “Stimulus Package.” The Stimulus is aimed at increasing the use of electronic health record (EHR) systems by medical practitioners.Optimism about the growth prospects of HCIT service providers has improved since the Stimulus package. Moreover, the “meaningful use” rule that enables hospitals to qualify for federal incentive program will boost business opportunities for the incumbents in the long-run. Beneficiaries of the Stimulus includeAllscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions(MDRX) andQuality Systems(QSII).WEAKNESSESJapan Debacle: Hurting MedTechThe impact of the recent massive earthquake (and subsequent Tsunami) in Japan and its aftermath on the medical devices industry appears to be substantial. Japan is the second-largest medical devices market after the U.S. It accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region.The roughly $25 billion Japanese medical devices sector has been an extremely successful market for American medical devices firms. U.S. firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.MedTech majors such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific andJohnson & Johnson's(JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan.The impact of the horrific disaster has been already felt as it has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It will inevitably result in delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products. Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis (as reflected in falling share prices), which is hard to gauge at this moment.Orthopedic Still a ConcernWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain until we see a complete economic recovery. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness. Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA).However, we do admit that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for players such as Stryker and Zimmer.Pricing Woes LingerPricing concerns on hips, knees and spine products have impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010. The pricing issue, at a macro-level, remains a key concern. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.A Broken BackThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience weak spine sales, which have somewhat shaken our confidence in these stocks.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market over the next few quarters. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Procedure Volume: Stabilizing but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe. The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010.A general sluggishness in the orthopedic industry has been evident from the weak sales reported by most of the leading players in this market. Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. On a somewhat positive note, recent trends indicate favorable procedure (hip/knees) volume growth, mostly likely due to pent-up patient demand.

(CE) will increase the prices of acetic acid, Acetic Anhydride, MIBC and MIBK by $0.03/LB and that of Vinyl Acetate Monomer and Ethyl Acetate by $0.05/LB in the US,  Canada and Mexico.A few days back, Celanese also announced that it will increase the prices of all emulsions sold in Europe, the Middle East and Africa by €90/t also effective July 1, 2011. This price increase includes all emulsions and affects applications including, but not limited to, adhesives, paint and coatings, building and construction, non wovens, glass fiber, carpet and textiles.Recently, Celanese reported that its first-quarter 2011 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings were 96 cents per share in the first quarter of 2011, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were 87 cents versus 6 cents in the prior-year quarter.Quarterly revenues grew 14% year over year to $1.6 billion, primarily due to higher volumes across all business segments as well as improved volumes. Results were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.5 billion.Operating profit jumped to $188 million from a loss of $14 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating margins came in at a positive 8.5% from a negative 99% last year.Celanese is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a leading global producer of high-performance engineered polymers. The company's earnings outlook has been improving driven by the strong performance in the Advanced Engineered Materials business.The company is operating its facilities in the Acetyl Intermediates segment at above the industry utilizationrate of 80%, which provides cost advantages. Capacity utilization has also improved in the Industrial Specialties segment due to the rising demand in the Asia Pacific.However, Celanese is exposed to volatile raw material (natural gas, ethylene and methanol) prices used in the production of basic chemicals in the Acetyl Intermediates segment, principally formaldehyde, acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomer.The company also faces stiff competition from larger peers,E.I.

Although a number of these issues are expected to linger over the second-half of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The highly-regulated medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest-growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies, given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling health care costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.An increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from healthc are reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011.Recently, in a bid to curb the nation's bloated budget deficit, the Obama administration has passed a bill which includes plans to cut health care expenditure. Under the bill, a 12-person bipartisan panel was created to recommend a sharp reduction in spending on government programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Medicare and Medicaid, which account for about 20% of the federal budget, represent a key target of the deficit-reduction plan. The bill aims to cut $2.4 trillion in federal government spending over the next decade.Federal budgetary pressure (given a potential reduction in U.S. government's health care spending) has raised reimbursement risk as payors may more actively pursue their cost reduction initiatives. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical devices companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – Changes on the Horizon?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices (to include devices such as infusion pumps) under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies. President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.In a shocking move, in late July 2011, the IOM recommended the FDA scrap the 510(k) process and replace it with a new regulatory framework that integrates pre-market clearance and better post-market surveillance. The IOM review concluded that the 510(k) process fails to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class II devices before they enter the market. The recommendation was met with immediate industry-wide criticism.However, the FDA noted that the IOM's recommendation is not binding and the 510(k) process should not be eliminated. The regulator is currently seeking public feedback on the proposal (a meeting scheduled in mid-September 2011) with plans in place to decide on potential changes in late September/early October 2011.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still-soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.Loading...Loading...These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro and radiation oncology products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD) andVarian Medical(VAR).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space.Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: A Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a spate of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well-positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies have a number of levers to pull and represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed weakness in its ICD business in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market. The company saw all-round growth during the second quarter, outstripping its own guidance, although the CRM segment remains challenging. After several quarters, growth in the Cardiovascular portfolio came as a pleasant surprise. Based on a strong quarter, the company raised its guidance for 2011. We recently upgraded the stock to Outperform.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify devices are already gaining notable traction.Several new products (including the quadripolar CRT-D systems) should boost the company's CRM share in 2011, despite the weak market conditions. However, we do account for the fact that approval of the highly-anticipated quadripolar CRT-D, has been pushed back to early fourth-quarter 2011 from mid-2011.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the second quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Apart from heart valve therapy, healthy growth at the critical care segment (led by Flotrac systems and pressure monitoring products) is also encouraging.Moreover, Edwards's robust balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Following the favorable recommendation of the FDA Advisory Panel for Sapien THV (for inoperable patients), the company is confident of receiving final approval by October 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.Another value proposition is robotic surgical systems makerIntuitive Surgical(ISRG). Intuitive's recurring revenue stream continues to grow and provides a shield against cyclicality of revenues, arising from the sale of discretionary capital equipment to hospitals. We believe that its da Vinci surgery system has the capacity to improve outcomes and cut down on procedure time.We expect a number of procedures that are currently completed either in an open surgical manner or with laparoscopy to be eventually replaced by da Vinci surgery, as robotic surgery becomes the standard of care in many instances. The company enjoys a virtual monopoly in robotic surgery with little competition. Intuitive expects total procedure count to increase in the band of 27%-29% year over year in fiscal 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools. Moreover, the company is also buying Sweden-based blood test systems maker Phadia for $3.5 billion.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage(LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude has registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. The company expects to commence the European clinical trial of Portico valve in late 2011 (launch expected by first-half 2013). Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for companies such asVolcano Corp.(VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession.However, results from the first two quarters of 2011 indicate a silver lining stemming from continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. A healthy replacement/upgrade cycle may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESImpact of Japan DebacleThe impact of the horrific March 11 earthquake in Japan and its aftermath has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products.Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region. U.S. medical devices firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.Medtronic,Boston ScientificandJohnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis, which is hard to gauge at this moment.A Still Clouded Orthopedic OutlookWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. The reconstructive market fundamentals (pricing and volume) remains challenging with little or no clear visibility for a material turnaround in second-half 2011.Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). We remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine Continues to HurtThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their results for the first two quarters of 2011.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market through 2011. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilizing but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy and reimbursement-related pushback.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe.The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010. Volume headwind is likely to sustain through the back half of 2011 as unemployment continues to influence procedure deferrals.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Most of the leading players in the orthopedic space reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter, echoing a general softness in the market.June quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although stabilized sequentially) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportINTUITIVE SURG (ISRG): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportTHERMO FISHER (TMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportVOLCANO CORP (VOLC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.In a shocking move, in late July 2011, the IOM recommended the FDA scrap the 510(k) process and replace it with a new regulatory framework that integrates pre-market clearance and better post-market surveillance. The IOM review concluded that the 510(k) process fails to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class II devices before they enter the market. The recommendation was met with immediate industry-wide criticism.However, the FDA noted that the IOM's recommendation is not binding and the 510(k) process should not be eliminated. The regulator is currently seeking public feedback on the proposal (a meeting scheduled in mid-September 2011) with plans in place to decide on potential changes in late September/early October 2011.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still-soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.Loading...Loading...These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro and radiation oncology products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD) andVarian Medical(VAR).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space.Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: A Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a spate of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well-positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies have a number of levers to pull and represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed weakness in its ICD business in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market. The company saw all-round growth during the second quarter, outstripping its own guidance, although the CRM segment remains challenging. After several quarters, growth in the Cardiovascular portfolio came as a pleasant surprise. Based on a strong quarter, the company raised its guidance for 2011. We recently upgraded the stock to Outperform.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify devices are already gaining notable traction.Several new products (including the quadripolar CRT-D systems) should boost the company's CRM share in 2011, despite the weak market conditions. However, we do account for the fact that approval of the highly-anticipated quadripolar CRT-D, has been pushed back to early fourth-quarter 2011 from mid-2011.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the second quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Apart from heart valve therapy, healthy growth at the critical care segment (led by Flotrac systems and pressure monitoring products) is also encouraging.Moreover, Edwards's robust balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Following the favorable recommendation of the FDA Advisory Panel for Sapien THV (for inoperable patients), the company is confident of receiving final approval by October 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.Another value proposition is robotic surgical systems makerIntuitive Surgical(ISRG). Intuitive's recurring revenue stream continues to grow and provides a shield against cyclicality of revenues, arising from the sale of discretionary capital equipment to hospitals. We believe that its da Vinci surgery system has the capacity to improve outcomes and cut down on procedure time.We expect a number of procedures that are currently completed either in an open surgical manner or with laparoscopy to be eventually replaced by da Vinci surgery, as robotic surgery becomes the standard of care in many instances. The company enjoys a virtual monopoly in robotic surgery with little competition. Intuitive expects total procedure count to increase in the band of 27%-29% year over year in fiscal 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools. Moreover, the company is also buying Sweden-based blood test systems maker Phadia for $3.5 billion.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage(LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude has registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. The company expects to commence the European clinical trial of Portico valve in late 2011 (launch expected by first-half 2013). Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for companies such asVolcano Corp.(VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession.However, results from the first two quarters of 2011 indicate a silver lining stemming from continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. A healthy replacement/upgrade cycle may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESImpact of Japan DebacleThe impact of the horrific March 11 earthquake in Japan and its aftermath has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products.Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region. U.S. medical devices firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.Medtronic,Boston ScientificandJohnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis, which is hard to gauge at this moment.A Still Clouded Orthopedic OutlookWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. The reconstructive market fundamentals (pricing and volume) remains challenging with little or no clear visibility for a material turnaround in second-half 2011.Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). We remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine Continues to HurtThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their results for the first two quarters of 2011.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market through 2011. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilizing but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy and reimbursement-related pushback.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe.The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010. Volume headwind is likely to sustain through the back half of 2011 as unemployment continues to influence procedure deferrals.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Most of the leading players in the orthopedic space reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter, echoing a general softness in the market.June quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although stabilized sequentially) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportINTUITIVE SURG (ISRG): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportTHERMO FISHER (TMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportVOLCANO CORP (VOLC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

Although a number of these issues are expected to linger over the second-half of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The highly-regulated medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest-growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies, given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling health care costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.An increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from healthc are reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011.Recently, in a bid to curb the nation's bloated budget deficit, the Obama administration has passed a bill which includes plans to cut health care expenditure. Under the bill, a 12-person bipartisan panel was created to recommend a sharp reduction in spending on government programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Medicare and Medicaid, which account for about 20% of the federal budget, represent a key target of the deficit-reduction plan. The bill aims to cut $2.4 trillion in federal government spending over the next decade.Federal budgetary pressure (given a potential reduction in U.S. government's health care spending) has raised reimbursement risk as payors may more actively pursue their cost reduction initiatives. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical devices companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – Changes on the Horizon?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices (to include devices such as infusion pumps) under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies.

Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis, which is hard to gauge at this moment.A Still Clouded Orthopedic OutlookWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. The reconstructive market fundamentals (pricing and volume) remains challenging with little or no clear visibility for a material turnaround in second-half 2011.Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). We remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine Continues to HurtThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their results for the first two quarters of 2011.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market through 2011. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilizing but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy and reimbursement-related pushback.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe.The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010. Volume headwind is likely to sustain through the back half of 2011 as unemployment continues to influence procedure deferrals.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Most of the leading players in the orthopedic space reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter, echoing a general softness in the market.June quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although stabilized sequentially) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportINTUITIVE SURG (ISRG): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportTHERMO FISHER (TMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportVOLCANO CORP (VOLC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

Although a number of these issues are expected to linger through the remainder of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling healthcare costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.Increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from the healthcare reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical device companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – More Stringent RegulationThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator has shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies.President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine, which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.The FDA plans to implement its new set of plans through a process of regulatory actions such as draft guidance and proposed regulations, which will be open to public feedback. CDRH stated that it will wait for the pending review report of the Institute of Medicine before making a final decision.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.Loading...Loading...OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro, radiation oncology and blood-related products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD),Varian Medical(VAR) andHaemonetics Corporation(HAE).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space in the wake of recovery.In addition, low global penetration and robust demand provides a positive long-term thesis for investing in the blood processing industry. Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a slew of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed slower market growth of ICD in the U.S. in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.We believe that the recently approved REVO MRI SureScan pacemaker and Arctic Front catheter should provide some support to Medtronic's CRM business. REVO is already gaining positive initial market acceptance and is expected to be key growth drivers going ahead. The company's struggling spinal franchise should also benefit gradually from the recent product launches.Moreover, Medtronic plans to adopt restructuring initiatives (including workforce reduction) to sustain long-term growth. The company is also blessed with strong cash flows which it prudently uses for maximizing shareholder value. Medtronic is active on the acquisition front and is investing in emerging markets, which it considers an increasingly important growth driver.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership position in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market with 46% share in the U.S. market. The launch of Taxus Element stent (commercialized as Ion) in the U.S. in April 2011 strongly places the company to gain DES share. Moreover, its pipeline DES product Promus Element (expected launch in the U.S. in mid-2012) is shaping up to be a major driver of its stent business. Besides, the acquisition of asthma-treatment company Asthmatx has enabled Boston Scientic to target the pulmonary devices area.Boston Scientific has undertaken a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives that are expected to contribute to the bottom line moving forward. The company plans to expand its footprint in the emerging markets by reinvesting the savings from restructuring efforts. In this context, we reckon the company's divestiture of its Neurovascular business as a smart move, enabling it to prepay a portion of the debt and invest in high growth markets.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify lines of ICDs are already gaining notable traction. Moreover, launch of several products (including the quadripolar CRT systems) should boost the company's CRM market share in 2011.The recent European clearance of the Accent MRI pacemaker and the approval ShockGuard technology, designed for use with the Fortify and Unify systems, represents an incremental positive for the company. Another encouraging prospect is St. Jude's April 2011 pact with health care supply contracting company Novation. Under the deal, Novation will make the company's CRM products available to some of the leading academic centers in the U.S. This should broaden the use of St. Jude's products and technologies and boost its market share.Moreover, the recent U.S. approval of two new irrigated ablation catheters (Safire BLU and Therapy Cool Path) for treating cardiac arrhythmias should help St. Jude sustain the healthy growth in Atrial Fibrillation through 2011.Trifecta, which was launched in Europe in fourth-quarter 2010 and was recently approved in the U.S., represents a major new driver for the company's Cardiovascular franchise. St. Jude's tissue valve business in Europe is growing more than 30% rate and the company expects similar growth in the U.S.We are also optimistic about the emerging opportunity in the intravascular imaging market, enabled by the company's LightLab acquisition in July 2010. Moreover, its $1.3 billion acquisition of heart devices maker AGA Medical Holdings will eventually make St. Jude a clear leader in the structural heart market. The company expects the acquisition to help its sales grow at a low double-digit rate in 2011.However, we do acknowledge the fact that a soft CRM market may be a drag on these stocks. The prevailing macroeconomic factors, pricing pressure, austerity measures and the impact of health care reform are expected to continue to weigh on the CRM market through 2011. Data for the U.S. defibrillators market, published in the first-quarter 2011, indicate deterioration in the defibrillator market growth rate, including the pricing impact.The CRM market also faces a number of challenges including physician reaction to recent study results published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (“JAMA”) regarding evidence-based guidelines for ICD implants and the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation into hospitals' ICD implants.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the first quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Moreover, Edwards's strong balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Importantly, its Sapien transcatheter heart valve is slated for review by the FDA Advisory Panel on July 20, 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth. Based on an upbeat Impella outlook, Abiomed recently issued a solid revenue guidance.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its coveted RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude recently registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for the incumbent players such as Volcano Corp. (VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for the MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession. However, first quarter results indicate continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. This may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESJapan Debacle: Greater Impact Looms?The impact of the March 11 earthquake (and Tsunami) in Japan and its aftermath on the medical devices industry appears to be substantial. Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region.The roughly $25 billion Japanese medical devices sector has been an extremely successful market for American medical devices firms. U.S. firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.MedTech majors such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific andJohnson & Johnson's(JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.The impact of the horrific disaster is being already felt as it has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products. The negative impact of the Japan crisis on MedTech companies with high exposure is expected to become more pronounced in the June quarter.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis (as reflected in falling share prices), which is hard to gauge at this moment.Softness in Orthopedic LingersWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). While most of these names beat expectations in the first quarter we remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes Here to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine: Still HurtsThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their March quarter results.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market over the next few quarters. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilized but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe . The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Both these companies reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter. A general sluggishness in procedure volume continues to impinge on the results of the leading players in the orthopedic market.March quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although manifesting some signs of sequential stabilization) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCONMED CORP (CNMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportHAEMONETICS CP (HAE): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportSPRINT NEXTEL (S): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportWRIGHT MEDICAL (WMGI): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."
3534,36269,Medical Devices Stock Outlook - June 2011 - Industry Outlook,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/06/1193884/medical-devices-stock-outloo,2011-06-22,EW,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...A host of macro headwinds (including price and procedure volume pressure) which hit the MedTech industry last year continued to haunt the sector during the March quarter and encumber growth. Although a number of these issues are expected to linger through the remainder of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling healthcare costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.Increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from the healthcare reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical device companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – More Stringent RegulationThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator has shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies.President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine, which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.The FDA plans to implement its new set of plans through a process of regulatory actions such as draft guidance and proposed regulations, which will be open to public feedback. CDRH stated that it will wait for the pending review report of the Institute of Medicine before making a final decision.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.Loading...Loading...OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro, radiation oncology and blood-related products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD),Varian Medical(VAR) andHaemonetics Corporation(HAE).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space in the wake of recovery.In addition, low global penetration and robust demand provides a positive long-term thesis for investing in the blood processing industry. Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a slew of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed slower market growth of ICD in the U.S. in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.We believe that the recently approved REVO MRI SureScan pacemaker and Arctic Front catheter should provide some support to Medtronic's CRM business. REVO is already gaining positive initial market acceptance and is expected to be key growth drivers going ahead. The company's struggling spinal franchise should also benefit gradually from the recent product launches.Moreover, Medtronic plans to adopt restructuring initiatives (including workforce reduction) to sustain long-term growth. The company is also blessed with strong cash flows which it prudently uses for maximizing shareholder value. Medtronic is active on the acquisition front and is investing in emerging markets, which it considers an increasingly important growth driver.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership position in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market with 46% share in the U.S. market. The launch of Taxus Element stent (commercialized as Ion) in the U.S. in April 2011 strongly places the company to gain DES share. Moreover, its pipeline DES product Promus Element (expected launch in the U.S. in mid-2012) is shaping up to be a major driver of its stent business. Besides, the acquisition of asthma-treatment company Asthmatx has enabled Boston Scientic to target the pulmonary devices area.Boston Scientific has undertaken a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives that are expected to contribute to the bottom line moving forward. The company plans to expand its footprint in the emerging markets by reinvesting the savings from restructuring efforts. In this context, we reckon the company's divestiture of its Neurovascular business as a smart move, enabling it to prepay a portion of the debt and invest in high growth markets.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify lines of ICDs are already gaining notable traction. Moreover, launch of several products (including the quadripolar CRT systems) should boost the company's CRM market share in 2011.The recent European clearance of the Accent MRI pacemaker and the approval ShockGuard technology, designed for use with the Fortify and Unify systems, represents an incremental positive for the company. Another encouraging prospect is St. Jude's April 2011 pact with health care supply contracting company Novation. Under the deal, Novation will make the company's CRM products available to some of the leading academic centers in the U.S. This should broaden the use of St. Jude's products and technologies and boost its market share.Moreover, the recent U.S. approval of two new irrigated ablation catheters (Safire BLU and Therapy Cool Path) for treating cardiac arrhythmias should help St. Jude sustain the healthy growth in Atrial Fibrillation through 2011.Trifecta, which was launched in Europe in fourth-quarter 2010 and was recently approved in the U.S., represents a major new driver for the company's Cardiovascular franchise. St. Jude's tissue valve business in Europe is growing more than 30% rate and the company expects similar growth in the U.S.We are also optimistic about the emerging opportunity in the intravascular imaging market, enabled by the company's LightLab acquisition in July 2010. Moreover, its $1.3 billion acquisition of heart devices maker AGA Medical Holdings will eventually make St. Jude a clear leader in the structural heart market. The company expects the acquisition to help its sales grow at a low double-digit rate in 2011.However, we do acknowledge the fact that a soft CRM market may be a drag on these stocks. The prevailing macroeconomic factors, pricing pressure, austerity measures and the impact of health care reform are expected to continue to weigh on the CRM market through 2011. Data for the U.S. defibrillators market, published in the first-quarter 2011, indicate deterioration in the defibrillator market growth rate, including the pricing impact.The CRM market also faces a number of challenges including physician reaction to recent study results published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (“JAMA”) regarding evidence-based guidelines for ICD implants and the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation into hospitals' ICD implants.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the first quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Moreover, Edwards's strong balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Importantly, its Sapien transcatheter heart valve is slated for review by the FDA Advisory Panel on July 20, 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth. Based on an upbeat Impella outlook, Abiomed recently issued a solid revenue guidance.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its coveted RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude recently registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for the incumbent players such as Volcano Corp. (VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for the MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession. However, first quarter results indicate continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. This may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESJapan Debacle: Greater Impact Looms?The impact of the March 11 earthquake (and Tsunami) in Japan and its aftermath on the medical devices industry appears to be substantial. Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region.The roughly $25 billion Japanese medical devices sector has been an extremely successful market for American medical devices firms. U.S. firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.MedTech majors such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific andJohnson & Johnson's(JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.The impact of the horrific disaster is being already felt as it has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products. The negative impact of the Japan crisis on MedTech companies with high exposure is expected to become more pronounced in the June quarter.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis (as reflected in falling share prices), which is hard to gauge at this moment.Softness in Orthopedic LingersWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). While most of these names beat expectations in the first quarter we remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes Here to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine: Still HurtsThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their March quarter results.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market over the next few quarters. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilized but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe . The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Both these companies reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter. A general sluggishness in procedure volume continues to impinge on the results of the leading players in the orthopedic market.March quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although manifesting some signs of sequential stabilization) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCONMED CORP (CNMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportHAEMONETICS CP (HAE): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportSPRINT NEXTEL (S): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportWRIGHT MEDICAL (WMGI): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

The company is said to be reaching an agreement to pay $8.5 billion to a group of investors who had suffered substantial losses for their investments in mortgage-backed securities sold by the company prior to the housing market failure, according to a Wall Street Journal report.The group of investors, including names such asBlackRock Inc.(BLK),MetLife Inc.(MET) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York alleged that prior to the financial crisis, Countrywide Financial Corp., a company that was acquired by BofA in 2008, had sold those securities that were tied to bad-quality loans.Neither the quality of the borrowers nor the collaterals matched the standards that Countrywide assured to the buyer of these securities. The loans were not even managed well and lacked proper paperwork. Therefore, these investors sought a buyback relief of $47 billion in mortgages backed securities that were offloaded by Countrywide Financial before it was acquired by BofA. The agreement, if reached, would close a nine-month fight between BofA and the investors.The acquisition of Countrywide substantially increased BofA's mortgage exposure. As a result, following the collapse of housing market, mortgage repurchases claim risk for the company has increased significantly. BofA reached agreements of similar nature but of lesser amounts earlier this year with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as withAssured Guaranty Ltd.(AGO).Such hefty payment, which represents the highest by a financial services company till date, would definitely dent BofA's financials and reputation. In addition to this, revenue headwinds and issues related U.S. regulatory reform continue to restrict the company's earnings.It could also motivate other investors to ask for claims from mortgage lenders likeWells Fargo & Co.(WFC) andJPMorgan Chase & Co.(JPM) for their mortgage-backed securities tied to soured loans.As such, we have an Underperform recommendation on the stock.  Shares of BofA also retain a Zacks #5 Rank, which translates into a short-term ‘Strong Sell' rating.ASSURED GUARNTY (AGO): Free Stock Analysis ReportBANK OF AMER CP (BAC): Free Stock Analysis ReportBLACKROCK INC (BLK): Free Stock Analysis ReportJPMORGAN CHASE (JPM): Free Stock Analysis ReportMETLIFE INC (MET): Free Stock Analysis ReportWELLS FARGO-NEW (WFC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

Although a number of these issues are expected to linger over the second-half of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The highly-regulated medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest-growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies, given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling health care costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.An increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from healthc are reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011.Recently, in a bid to curb the nation's bloated budget deficit, the Obama administration has passed a bill which includes plans to cut health care expenditure. Under the bill, a 12-person bipartisan panel was created to recommend a sharp reduction in spending on government programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Medicare and Medicaid, which account for about 20% of the federal budget, represent a key target of the deficit-reduction plan. The bill aims to cut $2.4 trillion in federal government spending over the next decade.Federal budgetary pressure (given a potential reduction in U.S. government's health care spending) has raised reimbursement risk as payors may more actively pursue their cost reduction initiatives. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical devices companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – Changes on the Horizon?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices (to include devices such as infusion pumps) under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies. President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.In a shocking move, in late July 2011, the IOM recommended the FDA scrap the 510(k) process and replace it with a new regulatory framework that integrates pre-market clearance and better post-market surveillance. The IOM review concluded that the 510(k) process fails to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class II devices before they enter the market. The recommendation was met with immediate industry-wide criticism.However, the FDA noted that the IOM's recommendation is not binding and the 510(k) process should not be eliminated. The regulator is currently seeking public feedback on the proposal (a meeting scheduled in mid-September 2011) with plans in place to decide on potential changes in late September/early October 2011.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still-soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.Loading...Loading...These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro and radiation oncology products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD) andVarian Medical(VAR).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space.Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: A Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a spate of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well-positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies have a number of levers to pull and represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed weakness in its ICD business in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market. The company saw all-round growth during the second quarter, outstripping its own guidance, although the CRM segment remains challenging. After several quarters, growth in the Cardiovascular portfolio came as a pleasant surprise. Based on a strong quarter, the company raised its guidance for 2011. We recently upgraded the stock to Outperform.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify devices are already gaining notable traction.Several new products (including the quadripolar CRT-D systems) should boost the company's CRM share in 2011, despite the weak market conditions. However, we do account for the fact that approval of the highly-anticipated quadripolar CRT-D, has been pushed back to early fourth-quarter 2011 from mid-2011.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the second quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Apart from heart valve therapy, healthy growth at the critical care segment (led by Flotrac systems and pressure monitoring products) is also encouraging.Moreover, Edwards's robust balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Following the favorable recommendation of the FDA Advisory Panel for Sapien THV (for inoperable patients), the company is confident of receiving final approval by October 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.Another value proposition is robotic surgical systems makerIntuitive Surgical(ISRG). Intuitive's recurring revenue stream continues to grow and provides a shield against cyclicality of revenues, arising from the sale of discretionary capital equipment to hospitals. We believe that its da Vinci surgery system has the capacity to improve outcomes and cut down on procedure time.We expect a number of procedures that are currently completed either in an open surgical manner or with laparoscopy to be eventually replaced by da Vinci surgery, as robotic surgery becomes the standard of care in many instances. The company enjoys a virtual monopoly in robotic surgery with little competition. Intuitive expects total procedure count to increase in the band of 27%-29% year over year in fiscal 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools. Moreover, the company is also buying Sweden-based blood test systems maker Phadia for $3.5 billion.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage(LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude has registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. The company expects to commence the European clinical trial of Portico valve in late 2011 (launch expected by first-half 2013). Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for companies such asVolcano Corp.(VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession.However, results from the first two quarters of 2011 indicate a silver lining stemming from continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. A healthy replacement/upgrade cycle may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESImpact of Japan DebacleThe impact of the horrific March 11 earthquake in Japan and its aftermath has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products.Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region. U.S. medical devices firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.Medtronic,Boston ScientificandJohnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis, which is hard to gauge at this moment.A Still Clouded Orthopedic OutlookWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. The reconstructive market fundamentals (pricing and volume) remains challenging with little or no clear visibility for a material turnaround in second-half 2011.Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). We remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine Continues to HurtThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their results for the first two quarters of 2011.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market through 2011. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilizing but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy and reimbursement-related pushback.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe.The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010. Volume headwind is likely to sustain through the back half of 2011 as unemployment continues to influence procedure deferrals.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Most of the leading players in the orthopedic space reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter, echoing a general softness in the market.June quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although stabilized sequentially) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportINTUITIVE SURG (ISRG): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportTHERMO FISHER (TMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportVOLCANO CORP (VOLC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."
7062,87615,Medical Devices Stock Outlook - Sept. 2011 - Zacks Analyst Interviews,https://www.benzinga.com/content/zacks-investment-research-all-commentary-articles/11/09/1905471/medical-devices-stock-outloo,2011-09-07,SYK,benzinga,"Loading...Loading...June quarter results mostly mirror the preceding quarter as a host of macro headwinds (including price and procedure volume pressures) continued to haunt the MedTech industry and weighed on the performance of the incumbent players. Although a number of these issues are expected to linger over the second-half of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The highly-regulated medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest-growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies, given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling health care costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.An increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from healthc are reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011.Recently, in a bid to curb the nation's bloated budget deficit, the Obama administration has passed a bill which includes plans to cut health care expenditure. Under the bill, a 12-person bipartisan panel was created to recommend a sharp reduction in spending on government programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Medicare and Medicaid, which account for about 20% of the federal budget, represent a key target of the deficit-reduction plan. The bill aims to cut $2.4 trillion in federal government spending over the next decade.Federal budgetary pressure (given a potential reduction in U.S. government's health care spending) has raised reimbursement risk as payors may more actively pursue their cost reduction initiatives. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical devices companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – Changes on the Horizon?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices (to include devices such as infusion pumps) under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies. President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.In a shocking move, in late July 2011, the IOM recommended the FDA scrap the 510(k) process and replace it with a new regulatory framework that integrates pre-market clearance and better post-market surveillance. The IOM review concluded that the 510(k) process fails to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class II devices before they enter the market. The recommendation was met with immediate industry-wide criticism.However, the FDA noted that the IOM's recommendation is not binding and the 510(k) process should not be eliminated. The regulator is currently seeking public feedback on the proposal (a meeting scheduled in mid-September 2011) with plans in place to decide on potential changes in late September/early October 2011.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still-soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.Loading...Loading...These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro and radiation oncology products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD) andVarian Medical(VAR).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space.Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: A Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a spate of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well-positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies have a number of levers to pull and represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed weakness in its ICD business in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market. The company saw all-round growth during the second quarter, outstripping its own guidance, although the CRM segment remains challenging. After several quarters, growth in the Cardiovascular portfolio came as a pleasant surprise. Based on a strong quarter, the company raised its guidance for 2011. We recently upgraded the stock to Outperform.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify devices are already gaining notable traction.Several new products (including the quadripolar CRT-D systems) should boost the company's CRM share in 2011, despite the weak market conditions. However, we do account for the fact that approval of the highly-anticipated quadripolar CRT-D, has been pushed back to early fourth-quarter 2011 from mid-2011.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the second quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Apart from heart valve therapy, healthy growth at the critical care segment (led by Flotrac systems and pressure monitoring products) is also encouraging.Moreover, Edwards's robust balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Following the favorable recommendation of the FDA Advisory Panel for Sapien THV (for inoperable patients), the company is confident of receiving final approval by October 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.Another value proposition is robotic surgical systems makerIntuitive Surgical(ISRG). Intuitive's recurring revenue stream continues to grow and provides a shield against cyclicality of revenues, arising from the sale of discretionary capital equipment to hospitals. We believe that its da Vinci surgery system has the capacity to improve outcomes and cut down on procedure time.We expect a number of procedures that are currently completed either in an open surgical manner or with laparoscopy to be eventually replaced by da Vinci surgery, as robotic surgery becomes the standard of care in many instances. The company enjoys a virtual monopoly in robotic surgery with little competition. Intuitive expects total procedure count to increase in the band of 27%-29% year over year in fiscal 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools. Moreover, the company is also buying Sweden-based blood test systems maker Phadia for $3.5 billion.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage(LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude has registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. The company expects to commence the European clinical trial of Portico valve in late 2011 (launch expected by first-half 2013). Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for companies such asVolcano Corp.(VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession.However, results from the first two quarters of 2011 indicate a silver lining stemming from continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment.

The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices (to include devices such as infusion pumps) under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies. President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.In a shocking move, in late July 2011, the IOM recommended the FDA scrap the 510(k) process and replace it with a new regulatory framework that integrates pre-market clearance and better post-market surveillance. The IOM review concluded that the 510(k) process fails to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class II devices before they enter the market. The recommendation was met with immediate industry-wide criticism.However, the FDA noted that the IOM's recommendation is not binding and the 510(k) process should not be eliminated. The regulator is currently seeking public feedback on the proposal (a meeting scheduled in mid-September 2011) with plans in place to decide on potential changes in late September/early October 2011.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still-soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.Loading...Loading...These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro and radiation oncology products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD) andVarian Medical(VAR).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space.Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: A Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a spate of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well-positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies have a number of levers to pull and represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed weakness in its ICD business in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market. The company saw all-round growth during the second quarter, outstripping its own guidance, although the CRM segment remains challenging. After several quarters, growth in the Cardiovascular portfolio came as a pleasant surprise. Based on a strong quarter, the company raised its guidance for 2011. We recently upgraded the stock to Outperform.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify devices are already gaining notable traction.Several new products (including the quadripolar CRT-D systems) should boost the company's CRM share in 2011, despite the weak market conditions. However, we do account for the fact that approval of the highly-anticipated quadripolar CRT-D, has been pushed back to early fourth-quarter 2011 from mid-2011.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the second quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Apart from heart valve therapy, healthy growth at the critical care segment (led by Flotrac systems and pressure monitoring products) is also encouraging.Moreover, Edwards's robust balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Following the favorable recommendation of the FDA Advisory Panel for Sapien THV (for inoperable patients), the company is confident of receiving final approval by October 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.Another value proposition is robotic surgical systems makerIntuitive Surgical(ISRG). Intuitive's recurring revenue stream continues to grow and provides a shield against cyclicality of revenues, arising from the sale of discretionary capital equipment to hospitals. We believe that its da Vinci surgery system has the capacity to improve outcomes and cut down on procedure time.We expect a number of procedures that are currently completed either in an open surgical manner or with laparoscopy to be eventually replaced by da Vinci surgery, as robotic surgery becomes the standard of care in many instances. The company enjoys a virtual monopoly in robotic surgery with little competition. Intuitive expects total procedure count to increase in the band of 27%-29% year over year in fiscal 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools. Moreover, the company is also buying Sweden-based blood test systems maker Phadia for $3.5 billion.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage(LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude has registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. The company expects to commence the European clinical trial of Portico valve in late 2011 (launch expected by first-half 2013). Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for companies such asVolcano Corp.(VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession.However, results from the first two quarters of 2011 indicate a silver lining stemming from continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. A healthy replacement/upgrade cycle may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESImpact of Japan DebacleThe impact of the horrific March 11 earthquake in Japan and its aftermath has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products.Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region. U.S. medical devices firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.Medtronic,Boston ScientificandJohnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis, which is hard to gauge at this moment.A Still Clouded Orthopedic OutlookWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. The reconstructive market fundamentals (pricing and volume) remains challenging with little or no clear visibility for a material turnaround in second-half 2011.Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). We remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine Continues to HurtThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their results for the first two quarters of 2011.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market through 2011. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilizing but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy and reimbursement-related pushback.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe.The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010. Volume headwind is likely to sustain through the back half of 2011 as unemployment continues to influence procedure deferrals.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Most of the leading players in the orthopedic space reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter, echoing a general softness in the market.June quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although stabilized sequentially) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportINTUITIVE SURG (ISRG): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportTHERMO FISHER (TMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportVOLCANO CORP (VOLC): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

Although a number of these issues are expected to linger through the remainder of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling healthcare costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.Increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from the healthcare reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical device companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – More Stringent RegulationThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator has shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies.President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine, which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.The FDA plans to implement its new set of plans through a process of regulatory actions such as draft guidance and proposed regulations, which will be open to public feedback. CDRH stated that it will wait for the pending review report of the Institute of Medicine before making a final decision.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products and procedures, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still soft economy, top-tier devices makers are continuing their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in integrating acquisitions and delivering operational synergies from them, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, we still recommend investors to eschew companies making non-life-sustaining products and procedures (including elective procedures such as hip and knee replacement), as they are still engulfed by softened patient demand.Loading...Loading...OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, neuro, radiation oncology and blood-related products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific Corporation(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),Edwards Lifesciences(EW),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(ABMD),Varian Medical(VAR) andHaemonetics Corporation(HAE).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and volume headwinds) in the cardiovascular space in the wake of recovery.In addition, low global penetration and robust demand provides a positive long-term thesis for investing in the blood processing industry. Also, the radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements, providing a compelling growth opportunity. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: Few Hiccups but Long-Term WinnersWith a slew of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment and several other barriers to growth. These companies represent a good bet for long-term investors.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in cardiovascular, neuro, spinal, diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company witnessed slower market growth of ICD in the U.S. in the most recent quarter, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device.We believe that the recently approved REVO MRI SureScan pacemaker and Arctic Front catheter should provide some support to Medtronic's CRM business. REVO is already gaining positive initial market acceptance and is expected to be key growth drivers going ahead. The company's struggling spinal franchise should also benefit gradually from the recent product launches.Moreover, Medtronic plans to adopt restructuring initiatives (including workforce reduction) to sustain long-term growth. The company is also blessed with strong cash flows which it prudently uses for maximizing shareholder value. Medtronic is active on the acquisition front and is investing in emerging markets, which it considers an increasingly important growth driver.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership position in the drug eluting stent (“DES”) market with 46% share in the U.S. market. The launch of Taxus Element stent (commercialized as Ion) in the U.S. in April 2011 strongly places the company to gain DES share. Moreover, its pipeline DES product Promus Element (expected launch in the U.S. in mid-2012) is shaping up to be a major driver of its stent business. Besides, the acquisition of asthma-treatment company Asthmatx has enabled Boston Scientic to target the pulmonary devices area.Boston Scientific has undertaken a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives that are expected to contribute to the bottom line moving forward. The company plans to expand its footprint in the emerging markets by reinvesting the savings from restructuring efforts. In this context, we reckon the company's divestiture of its Neurovascular business as a smart move, enabling it to prepay a portion of the debt and invest in high growth markets.We remain intrigued by St. Jude's ability to consistently produce positive earnings surprises and revenue growth. The company is poised for incremental opportunities in CRM on the back of strong product momentum. St. Jude's Fortify and Unify lines of ICDs are already gaining notable traction. Moreover, launch of several products (including the quadripolar CRT systems) should boost the company's CRM market share in 2011.The recent European clearance of the Accent MRI pacemaker and the approval ShockGuard technology, designed for use with the Fortify and Unify systems, represents an incremental positive for the company. Another encouraging prospect is St. Jude's April 2011 pact with health care supply contracting company Novation. Under the deal, Novation will make the company's CRM products available to some of the leading academic centers in the U.S. This should broaden the use of St. Jude's products and technologies and boost its market share.Moreover, the recent U.S. approval of two new irrigated ablation catheters (Safire BLU and Therapy Cool Path) for treating cardiac arrhythmias should help St. Jude sustain the healthy growth in Atrial Fibrillation through 2011.Trifecta, which was launched in Europe in fourth-quarter 2010 and was recently approved in the U.S., represents a major new driver for the company's Cardiovascular franchise. St. Jude's tissue valve business in Europe is growing more than 30% rate and the company expects similar growth in the U.S.We are also optimistic about the emerging opportunity in the intravascular imaging market, enabled by the company's LightLab acquisition in July 2010. Moreover, its $1.3 billion acquisition of heart devices maker AGA Medical Holdings will eventually make St. Jude a clear leader in the structural heart market. The company expects the acquisition to help its sales grow at a low double-digit rate in 2011.However, we do acknowledge the fact that a soft CRM market may be a drag on these stocks. The prevailing macroeconomic factors, pricing pressure, austerity measures and the impact of health care reform are expected to continue to weigh on the CRM market through 2011. Data for the U.S. defibrillators market, published in the first-quarter 2011, indicate deterioration in the defibrillator market growth rate, including the pricing impact.The CRM market also faces a number of challenges including physician reaction to recent study results published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (“JAMA”) regarding evidence-based guidelines for ICD implants and the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation into hospitals' ICD implants.Beyond the MedTech giants, Edwards Lifesciences represents another value proposition. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the first quarter, banking on robust performance of its heart valve therapy products. Moreover, Edwards's strong balance sheet enables it to target suitable acquisitions. Importantly, its Sapien transcatheter heart valve is slated for review by the FDA Advisory Panel on July 20, 2011. The U.S. approval of the device should offer a major boost to the company's sales in the long term.Another interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements. Moreover, its significant international presence should also push growth.We also believe that cardiac assist devices maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth. Based on an upbeat Impella outlook, Abiomed recently issued a solid revenue guidance.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its coveted RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.We are also optimistic about scientific instrument makerThermo Fisher Scientific(TMO). The company has been successful in expanding operating margins over the past few quarters on the back of operational efficiency and cost control. Thermo Fisher has strong international exposure and is focusing on emerging market for growth.The company's strong cash position enables it to make suitable acquisitions. Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude recently registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for the incumbent players such as Volcano Corp. (VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for the MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession. However, first quarter results indicate continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. This may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESJapan Debacle: Greater Impact Looms?The impact of the March 11 earthquake (and Tsunami) in Japan and its aftermath on the medical devices industry appears to be substantial. Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region.The roughly $25 billion Japanese medical devices sector has been an extremely successful market for American medical devices firms. U.S. firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.MedTech majors such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific andJohnson & Johnson's(JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.The impact of the horrific disaster is being already felt as it has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products. The negative impact of the Japan crisis on MedTech companies with high exposure is expected to become more pronounced in the June quarter.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis (as reflected in falling share prices), which is hard to gauge at this moment.Softness in Orthopedic LingersWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). While most of these names beat expectations in the first quarter we remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes Here to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine: Still HurtsThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their March quarter results.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market over the next few quarters. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilized but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe . The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Both these companies reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter. A general sluggishness in procedure volume continues to impinge on the results of the leading players in the orthopedic market.March quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although manifesting some signs of sequential stabilization) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCONMED CORP (CNMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportHAEMONETICS CP (HAE): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportSPRINT NEXTEL (S): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportWRIGHT MEDICAL (WMGI): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

Although a number of these issues are expected to linger through the remainder of 2011, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year thanks to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The medical devices industry is divided into different segments including Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic Devices. The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, backed by an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, orthopedic and aesthetic represent the fastest growing categories.Last year was challenging for medical device companies given the exigent economic conditions and a precarious healthcare environment. The MedTech industry faced several issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks.While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product cycles, an aging population, geographic expansion, ongoing transition towards minimally-invasive techniques and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year are expected to remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.Given the maturing legacy markets, medical device companies are looking to expand into lucrative incipient markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.Pros and Cons of U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies will be a drag. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling healthcare costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.Increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from the healthcare reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical device companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.The 510(k) Reform – More Stringent RegulationThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, in August 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan in January 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices.

Moreover, the acquisition of leading chromatography systems maker Dionex Corporation has provided Thermo Fisher ample scope to further strengthen its position in mass spectrometry, representing one of the fastest growing categories in life sciences tools.Emerging Markets: A Lucrative ProspectThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets.Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies. St. Jude recently registered the first human implant of its next-generation TAVI product dubbed Portico. Medtronic's TAVI offering, CoreValve, is currently undergoing evaluation in a pivotal trial in the U.S.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for the incumbent players such as Volcano Corp. (VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit clip over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Improving Hospital Spending CycleA soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for the MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession. However, first quarter results indicate continued recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. This may turn into a potential driver moving forward.WEAKNESSESJapan Debacle: Greater Impact Looms?The impact of the March 11 earthquake (and Tsunami) in Japan and its aftermath on the medical devices industry appears to be substantial. Japan is the second-largest medical devices market (after the U.S.) and accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region.The roughly $25 billion Japanese medical devices sector has been an extremely successful market for American medical devices firms. U.S. firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.MedTech majors such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific andJohnson & Johnson's(JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have a strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan and envision lower sales from this region to weigh on their top line in 2011.The impact of the horrific disaster is being already felt as it has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It has resulted in some delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products. The negative impact of the Japan crisis on MedTech companies with high exposure is expected to become more pronounced in the June quarter.Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis (as reflected in falling share prices), which is hard to gauge at this moment.Softness in Orthopedic LingersWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness, exacerbated by sustained pricing pressure. Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA). While most of these names beat expectations in the first quarter we remain cynical about these stocks given the sustained price/volume pressure.However, we acknowledge that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for these players.Pricing Woes Here to StayPricing compressions on hips, knees and spine products, which impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010, remain a key concern, at the macro-level. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.Spine: Still HurtsThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds and payor push back as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience price and volume pressure, which was evident in their March quarter results.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market over the next few quarters. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Volume: Stabilized but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe . The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010.Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. Both these companies reported weak knee sales in the most recent quarter. A general sluggishness in procedure volume continues to impinge on the results of the leading players in the orthopedic market.March quarter trends indicate that procedure volume growth across hip and knee markets still remain sluggish (although manifesting some signs of sequential stabilization) and a material turnaround is not likely at least in the near term. In fact, the timing of the rebound in procedure volume to pre-recession level remains unclear, at this stage. As such, we continue to recommend investors to steer clear of the above-mentioned orthopedic stocks until a substantial recovery in the pricing/volume environment materializes.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCONMED CORP (CNMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportEDWARDS LIFESCI (EW): Free Stock Analysis ReportHAEMONETICS CP (HAE): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportSPRINT NEXTEL (S): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportWRIGHT MEDICAL (WMGI): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

The MedTech industry was hit by several macro headwinds in 2010 including price/volume and utilization pressure and a more restrictive regulatory environment. Although a number of these issues remain, the industry is expected to fare better this year due to several tailwinds and growth opportunities.Industry DynamicsThe global medical devices industry is fairly large, intensely competitive and highly innovative, with estimated worldwide sales of more than $300 billion in 2011. The U.S. is the largest medical devices market, with estimated sales of roughly $95 billion in 2010.The medical devices industry is divided into different segments such as Cardiology, Oncology, Neuro, Orthopedic, Aesthetic Devices and Healthcare IT (“HCIT”). The U.S. medical devices industry continues to grow at a brisk pace, thanks to an aging Baby Boomer population, high unmet medical needs and increased incidence of lifestyle diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and obesity). Neuro, Orthopedic and Aesthetic represent the fastest growing categories.The MedTech industry faced a host of issues in 2010, including pricing concerns, hospital admission and procedural volume pressures, health care reform, reimbursement pressures and increasing regulatory involvements, which put investors in a dilemma about these stocks. While several catalysts for growth in 2011 exist -- such as new product launches, an aging population, geographic expansion and emerging markets -- lingering issues from last year remain an overhang.The aging population represents a major catalyst for demand of medical devices. The elderly population (persons 65 years and above) base in the U.S. was roughly 40 million in 2010, representing around 13% of the nation's population and accounting for a third of health care consumption. Federal government estimates indicate that the elderly population will catapult to 72 million by 2030, ensuing a major boost for medical devices utilization.With several growth constraints in the legacy markets, medical device companies are aiming to expand into lucrative new markets. Expansion in the emerging markets, especially those with double-digit annual growth rates, represents one of the best potential avenues for growth in 2011 and beyond.U.S. Healthcare ReformThe Government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S. enacted last year -- the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act -- has created a degree of uncertainty for medical devices companies. The reform has led to a less flexible pricing environment for these companies and may pressure pricing across the board.Moreover, the proposed tax on device companies may hit their bottom lines. Nevertheless, the Act places considerable emphasis on patient safety and aims to reduce the number of uninsured people (from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016). The new law is expected to eventually extend health insurance coverage to an estimated 32 million Americans currently not insured.Reimbursement ScenarioMedical device companies are susceptible to significant reimbursement risks as their products are reimbursed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”) and commercial payers. Third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, both government-funded and commercially insured, continue to develop different means of controlling healthcare costs, including prospective reimbursement cuts with careful review of medical bills and stringent pre-approval requirements.Increase in the publicly insured base (resulting from the healthcare reform) is expected to lead to lower reimbursement obtained by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as public insurance generally offers lower reimbursement vis-à-vis private payors. Moreover, private insurance companies are increasing their scrutiny of certain surgeries, which may materially impact utilization in 2011. Changes in reimbursement policy significantly impact medical device companies as they hurt demand for their products and revenues.Regulatory Landscape - The 510(k) ReformThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared, on August 3, 2010, a set of ambitious proposals for revamping the 510(k) device approval protocols. The 200-page report, consisting of 55 proposed changes, was designed to serve as a blueprint for the reform, representing FDA's vision to streamline the device review process and make it more predictable and transparent.As part of the listed proposals, the FDA intends to create the “Center Science Council,” which will oversee medical device science-based decision-making. Moreover, the regulator is seeking additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of devices in the 510(k) submissions. The FDA also aims to form a subset of moderately risky devices under the “Class IIb” moniker that would require submission of more clinical data and manufacturing information compared to the existing Class II devices.In a major move, the FDA outlined a plan on January 19, 2011, consisting of 25 proposals, which it intends to implement during 2011 to improve the regulatory approval pathway for medical devices. Most of these proposals, announced by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), appear favorable for the medical devices industry.The proposals are aimed at overhauling the three-and-a-half-decade-old 510(k) device approval program by which roughly 4,000 devices have been cleared annually. The list includes streamlining the de novo review process for lower-risk devices, clarifying when devices companies should submit clinical data for a 510(k) application and establishing a new council of senior FDA experts.However, interestingly, the regulator has shelved the most controversial issues of its previously-announced proposals including a definition of its authority to rescind approval of potentially unsafe or ineffective products and the creation of a new category of devices, which have drawn sneers from industry groups and devices companies. President Obama emphasized that the planned changes represent the government's efforts to keep patients safer and accelerate the approval process of innovative and life-saving products.The CDRH forwarded seven of the controversial proposals to the Institute of Medicine, which provides national advice on medical issues, for independent review with feedback expected in mid-2011. These issues were met with significant concerns as indicated in the comments submitted to the public docket.The FDA plans to implement its new set of plans through a process of regulatory actions such as draft guidance and proposed regulations, which will be open to public feedback. CDRH stated that it will wait for the pending review report of the Institute of Medicine before making a final decision. Moreover, the regulator is planning for a public meeting in April 2011 to seek feedback on two other issues.While the 510(k) overhaul is still in process, it may eventually make device approval more complex, lengthy and burdensome. Moreover, with the expected rise in the regulatory bar for approvals, medical devices companies may be required to shell out more for R&D.Our ThesisWe continue to recommend companies providing life-sustaining products, given their strong recurring stream of revenues as patients are unable to forego these products. Furthermore, investors should look at companies with strong earnings quality and liquidity profiles. These companies appear attractive considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value (via dividends/share repurchases).Large companies with a wide product portfolio/healthy pipeline and strong infrastructure are also better poised for improved returns. Moreover, companies focusing on more judicious R&D investment, expansion into new markets and cost-saving through restructuring are better placed in 2011. These companies have greater capability of withstanding the sustained macro-level issues and increasing regulatory pressure.Pressed by a still struggling economy, top-tier devices makers are expected to continue their merger/acquisition binge in 2011, especially as a means to enter new markets and diversify their portfolio. Although this represents an important means for growth, we continue to advise investors to shun companies that have grown historically through extensive acquisitions only.These companies may find it difficult to fund acquisitions considering the lingering impact of the recession. Also, they face increasing challenges in delivering operational synergies from these acquisitions, which are considered to be the prime reason for failures of mergers and acquisitions.OPPORTUNITIESIn our universe, we see growth potential in companies dealing with cardiovascular devices, Neuro, radiation oncology and blood-related products. Names includeMedtronic Inc.(MDT),Boston Scientific CorporationLoading...Loading...(BSX),St. Jude Medical(STJ),ZOLL Medical(ZOLL),Abiomed Inc.(AMBD),Cyberonics Inc.(CYBX),Varian Medical(VAR),Accuray Incorporated(ARAY),Haemonetics Corporation(HAE).The above-listed companies produce life-sustaining products and are less affected by economic turbulence. Some of these companies have been successful in weathering the storm (pricing, currency and procedure growth headwinds) in the cardiovascular space in the wake of recovery. In addition, low global penetration and robust demand provides a positive long-term thesis for investing in the blood processing industry. These companies are all leading players in their respective fields and are potential winners in the long run.MedTech Giants: Long-Term WinnersWith a slew of new products, the Big Three players (Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude) in the $6.5 billion implantable cardioverter defibrillator (“ICD”) market are well positioned to gain market share, despite the challenging business environment. However, we do acknowledge the fact that a soft CRM market may be a drag on these stocks. The prevailing macroeconomic factors, pricing pressure, austerity measures and the impact of health care reform are expected to continue to weigh on the CRM market through 2011.Among the names above, Medtronic, the undisputed leader in the MedTech space, has a diversified presence in Cardiovascular, Neuro, Spinal, Diabetes and ENT and boasts an attractive pipeline. Although the company lost some U.S. ICD market share in the most recent quarter due to competition, new products should gradually contribute to growth and help it maintain/gain ICD share.The long-awaited issue of the FDA warning letters, relating to Medtronic's Mounds View facility and manufacturing unit in Puerto Rico, was finally resolved in March 2011, paving the way for the U.S. approval and launch of new products including the much-anticipated Protecta ICD device. While Protecta ICD has yet to be cleared in the U.S., it continues to perform very well in Europe.We believe that the recent approval of the REVO MRI SureScan pacemaker and Arctic Front catheter should provide some support to Medtronic's CRM business. Its spinal segment should also benefit gradually from the recent product launches.Moreover, Medtronic plans to adopt restructuring initiatives (including workforce reduction) to sustain long-term growth. The company is also blessed with strong cash flows which it prudently uses for maximizing shareholder value. Medtronic is active on the acquisition front and is investing in emerging markets, which it considers an increasingly important growth driver.Boston Scientific has maintained its leadership position in the global drug eluting stent (“DES”) market with 35% share (46% in the US market). Importantly, its pipeline DES product Promus Element is shaping up to be a major driver of its stent business. Moreover, we are also encouraged by Boston Scientic's acquisition of asthma-treatment company Asthmatx, which will enable it to target the pulmonary devices area.Boston Scientific has undertaken a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives that are expected to contribute to the bottom line moving forward. The company plans to expand its footprint in the emerging markets by reinvesting the savings from restructuring efforts. In this context, we reckon the company's divestiture of its Neurovascular business as a smart move, enabling it to prepay a portion of the debt and invest in high growth markets.St. Jude is poised to grow its market share in the CRM segment (especially in ICDs), driven by its new Fortify and Unify lines of devices. Launch of several products (including the quadripolar CRT systems) in the U.S. and Europe should boost the company's CRM market share in 2011. Moreover, we are optimistic about the emerging opportunity in the intravascular imaging market, enabled by the company's LightLab acquisition in July 2010.St. Jude's EnSite mapping system for diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmia continues to be the key driving force in atrial fibrillation. Also, its $1.3 billion acquisition of heart devices maker AGA Medical Holdings will eventually make St. Jude a clear leader in the structural heart market. The company expects the acquisition to help its sales grow at a low double-digit rate in 2011.Beyond the MedTech giants, an interesting pick in our portfolio is resuscitation devices-maker ZOLL Medical. ZOLL is a leading player in the global market for external defibrillators, which is worth more than $1 billion. The company's LifeVest wearable defibrillator business continues to grow at a healthy quarterly run rate, benefiting from increased awareness of the product and associated sales force enhancements.We also believe that cardiac assist devices-maker Abiomed represents another favorable opportunity for investors. The company possesses a broad portfolio of products that are life-sustaining in nature and has been able to deliver sustainable growth in a challenging economy. Abiomed enjoys strong demand for its Impella cardiac pumps. Higher Impella sales continue to fuel double-digit revenue growth. Based on healthy Impella demand trend, Abiomed has raised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2011.We are also optimistic about companies in the radiation oncology market such as Varian and Accuray. The radiation oncology market is benefiting from improving trends and technology advancements which are expected to boost the performance of these companies in 2011.Accuray is a global leader in the field of radiosurgery and continues to enjoy healthy demand for its CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery systems as evidenced by sustained growth in the number of patients receiving treatment with the device. Notably, the company's acquisition of its rivalTomoTherapy(TOMO) will reinforce its foothold in the radiation oncology space.Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer. The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology market. Varian is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its coveted RapidArc radiotherapy technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its oncology net order growth. Strong order activity in oncology coupled with healthy momentum in the X-ray products business will set the stage for better performance in 2011.Emerging Markets: An Opportunity to DiversifyThe leading U.S. cardiovascular devices companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude are exploring new avenues of growth beyond the mature pacemaker and ICD markets. These companies are increasingly seeking opportunities to expand into fast-growing new therapy areas within or outside the cardiology space, including markets such as atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation.Among the emerging cardiology markets, an encouraging prospect represents the structural heart market with its major categories including Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) and Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) occlusion. The AGA acquisition has provided St. Jude with devices targeted at PFO and LAA markets. Moreover, the Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVI) market, a potential blockbuster prospect, is emerging as a substantial new growth opportunity for the top-tier MedTech companies.Intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and other next-generation imaging technologies are expected to offer incremental opportunity for the incumbent players such asVolcano Corp.(VOLC), Boston Scientific and St. Jude. The OCT market has been projected to grow at a double-digit rate over the next five years. We believe that emerging markets represent a key catalyst for growth in 2011 and beyond.Hospital Spending: A Potential Tailwind?A soft hospital capital spending backdrop was challenging for the MedTech stocks in 2010. The North American and European markets were affected by shrinking budgets for equipment purchases at the height of the recession. However, recent quarterly results indicate signs of recovery in hospital spending in the U.S. Spending levels are improving as hospitals appear to have started replacing their worn-out equipment. This may turn into a potential driver moving forward.Federal “Stimulus”: A Boon for HCITsAnother area which is interestingly poised for growth these days is Healthcare IT. The landscape has changed since the Obama Administration took initiatives to encourage hospitals and physicians to modernize their health record-keeping as part of the “Stimulus Package.” The Stimulus is aimed at increasing the use of electronic health record (EHR) systems by medical practitioners.Optimism about the growth prospects of HCIT service providers has improved since the Stimulus package. Moreover, the “meaningful use” rule that enables hospitals to qualify for federal incentive program will boost business opportunities for the incumbents in the long-run. Beneficiaries of the Stimulus includeAllscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions(MDRX) andQuality Systems(QSII).WEAKNESSESJapan Debacle: Hurting MedTechThe impact of the recent massive earthquake (and subsequent Tsunami) in Japan and its aftermath on the medical devices industry appears to be substantial. Japan is the second-largest medical devices market after the U.S. It accounts for roughly 45% of the medical devices industry in the Asia-Pacific region.The roughly $25 billion Japanese medical devices sector has been an extremely successful market for American medical devices firms. U.S. firms account for roughly 60% of all imported medical devices products in Japan.MedTech majors such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific andJohnson & Johnson's(JNJ) Depuy has a major exposure to the Japanese medical devices sector. Other key players such asAbbott Laboratories(ABT), St. Jude,Stryker Corporation(SYK),Becton, Dickinson(BDX) andZimmer Holdings(ZMH) also have strong foothold in this lucrative market. Many of these players derive sizable revenues from Japan.The impact of the horrific disaster has been already felt as it has led to a major disruption in the global supply chain with Japan being a critical link. It will inevitably result in delays in shipments, elective surgical procedures and regulatory clearance for new products. Investors in devices companies, especially those with large export businesses in Japan, have been concerned over the long-term effect of the Japan crisis (as reflected in falling share prices), which is hard to gauge at this moment.Orthopedic Still a ConcernWe continue to advise investors to spurn companies in the orthopedic domain until we see a complete economic recovery. Companies in this space continue to struggle as patients defer their elective procedures given the lingering economic softness. Companies that fit the bill include Stryker, Zimmer Holdings,CONMED Corporation(CNMD),Wright Medical Group(WMGI) andSymmetry Medical(SMA).However, we do admit that companies such as Stryker and Zimmer, with less exposure to metal-on-metal (MoM) hip products, are better placed to gain share in 2011 than their highly-exposed counterparts such as JNJ/Depuy and Wright Medical. The ongoing transition from MoM implants to next-generation hip systems represents a tailwind for players such as Stryker and Zimmer.Pricing Woes LingerPricing concerns on hips, knees and spine products have impaired the performances of most of the orthopedic companies in 2010. The pricing issue, at a macro-level, remains a key concern. The effect of government health care cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts create additional reasons for hospitals to push back pricing. This is expected to continue hurt selling prices on a global basis.Moreover, the advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which act as agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members, has also put pressure on pricing. The prevailing economic climate has bolstered the bargaining power of GPOs. The pricing scenario in 2011 is expected to stay the same as last year as hospitals continue to push back pricing.A Broken BackThe U.S. spine market, which grew at a double-digit rate in 2009, took a tumble in 2010. The spinal market was worst hit by the pricing/volume headwinds as manifested by a moribund quarterly growth trend. Leading companies in the orthopedic space such as Stryker and Zimmer continue to experience weak spine sales, which have somewhat shaken our confidence in these stocks.Pricing pressure and reimbursement uncertainties coupled with austerity measures in Europe are expected continue to weigh on this market over the next few quarters. Moreover, private payors are delaying spine surgeries by requiring more documentation before approving such procedures, thereby contributing to the slowdown in this market.Procedure Volume: Stabilizing but Still a HeadwindThe $12 billion replacement hips and knees markets have been affected by lingering economic softness, as reflected in procedure volume pressure. Cash-strapped patients continue to defer surgeries given the weak economy.Procedural volumes in the U.S. have been negatively impacted as a result of a high unemployment rate, which has resulted in the expiry of health insurance as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.As per the demographic analysis, these trends had a significant impact on the potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age and without any Medicare coverage. On the other hand, austerity measures are contributing to the reduction in procedure volumes in Europe. The hip/knee market in Europe is expected to remain challenged in 2011, but to a lesser extent than 2010.A general sluggishness in the orthopedic industry has been evident from the weak sales reported by most of the leading players in this market. Companies such as Stryker and Zimmer derive a chunk of their revenues from replacement hips and knees. On a somewhat positive note, recent trends indicate favorable procedure (hip/knees) volume growth, mostly likely due to pent-up patient demand. While this may point to a bounce-back, a material turnaround is not likely in 2011.ABIOMED INC (ABMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis ReportACCURAY INC (ARAY): Free Stock Analysis ReportBECTON DICKINSO (BDX): Free Stock Analysis ReportBOSTON SCIENTIF (BSX): Free Stock Analysis ReportCYBERONICS INC (CYBX): Free Stock Analysis ReportHAEMONETICS CP (HAE): Free Stock Analysis ReportJOHNSON & JOHNS (JNJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportMEDTRONIC (MDT): Free Stock Analysis ReportST JUDE MEDICAL (STJ): Free Stock Analysis ReportSTRYKER CORP (SYK): Free Stock Analysis ReportTOMOTHERAPY INC (TOMO): Free Stock Analysis ReportVARIAN MEDICAL (VAR): Free Stock Analysis ReportZIMMER HOLDINGS (ZMH): Free Stock Analysis ReportZOLL MEDICAL CO (ZOLL): Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment ResearchLoading...Loading..."

The device dubbed EVOLVE Elbow Plating System (“EPS”) is an anatomic plating system for the treatment of fractures of the distal humerus (the long bone that runs from the shoulder to the elbow) and proximal ulna (a long bone in the forearm).Fracture in the distal humerus leads to the impairment of elbow joint function, which coordinates the movements of the upper extremity. Ulna fracture, on the other hand, impairs the function of the forearm.More than 200,000 elbow fracturesoccur annually involving distal humerus and proximal ulna with most of them requiring surgery. However, treatment of these fractures remains challenging for orthopedic surgeons.EVOLVE EPS, which is composed of polished stainless steel and leverages Wright Medical's advanced ORTHOLOC polyaxial locking technology, has been fine tuned to accurately match the patient anatomy to minimize the need for intra-operative bending while reducing post-operative irritation.The ORTHOLOC technology offers surgeons with greater flexibility in placing a locking screw and enables them to solidly lock the screw to the plate, thereby providing enhanced stability.EVOLVE EPS is the new addition to Wright Medical's EVOLVE elbow product line which consists of the market-leading EVOLVE modular radial head and EVOLVE radial head plate for treating the fractures of the proximal radius. The new system further reinforces the company's elbow product franchise.Wright Medical is a global orthopedic devices company specializing in the design, manufacture and marketing of reconstructive joint devices and bio-orthopedic materials. It is a leading provider of surgical solutions for the foot and ankle market.We feel, future revenue growth will be supported by new product (including internally developed and those from acquisitions) launches. Moreover, new deals in extremities, Wright Medical's fastest growing segment, are expected to bolster growth in this business.Our views are moderated by intense competition from larger players, pricing pressure, and a still soft U.S. orthopedic reconstruction market. Wright Medical competes with much larger players such asZimmer Holdings(ZMH),Stryker(SYK),Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) De Puy andSmith & Nephew(SNN).

The results of the company were also lower than year-ago earnings of 34 cents per share.GAAP earnings per share in the quarter were 9 cents versus 36 cents in the fourth quarter of 2009.The difference between the GAAP and operating earnings during the reported quarter was due to the impact of a few one-time items. These are a gain of 10 cents on Midstream joint venture, a 2 cent impact due to changes in legacy derivative contracts, a 12 cent impact for E&P financial derivatives, 1 cent owing to ceiling test charges to a tax adjustment and 10 cents due to loss on debt extinguishment.El Paso's 2010 operating earnings were 98 cents per share compared with $1.29 per share reported in 2009. Fiscal 2010 earnings also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00 as provided by 11 covering analysts.Earnings per share, as per GAAP, in 2010 were $1.00 versus a loss of 83 cents in 2009.The difference between the GAAP and operating earnings during the year was due to the impact of a few one-time items. These include a gain of 9 cents on Midstream joint venture, a gain of 8 cents on Mexican pipeline assets, a 7 cent impact for E&P financial derivatives and a benefit of 1 cent from liquidation of foreign entities.These benefits were negatively impacted by 3 cents due to ceiling test charges, a loss of 18 cents from debt extinguishment and 2 cents due to health care legislation.RevenueTotal revenue of the company at the end of the fourth quarter was $984 million versus $1.19 billion in the year-ago period, which reflects a decline of 17.5%.Quarterly revenue was lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21 billion.The company generated total revenue of $4.61 billion in 2010, marginally down from $4.63 billion reported in 2009.Total 2010 revenue was also lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.74 billion.Quarterly HighlightsEl Paso's cash operating costs for the fourth quarter of 2010 averaged $1.84 per thousand cubic feet (Mcfe), up from $1.81 per Mcfe for the same period in 2009, primarily due to higher production taxes.Total operating expenses of the company at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010 were $603 million versus $695 million in the year-ago period. However, the decrease in cost did not benefit the operating results of the company affected as it was by a much lower top line.Operating income during the fourth quarter 2010 dropped by $117 million to $381 million from the year-ago quarter.Annual HighlightsDuring the year the company experienced a substantial year-over-year decline in total operating expenses. The expenses were cut by 45% from the year-ago level mainly due to ceiling test changes.The decrease in operating expenses percolated down to benefit operating income. Operating income in 2010 was an impressive $2.04 billion versus a loss of $51 million in 2009.Interest expenses at the end of 2010 were $1.03 billion, 2.3% higher than 2009 levels.

Lower natural gas volumes, higher operating expenses along with increased operating taxes affected the segment's operating income.Williams Partners:This segment reported an operating profit of $1.54 billion in 2010, up from the year-ago level of $1.29 billion, primarily based on higher natural gas liquid (NGL) margins and improved equity volumes (following full-year production at Willow Creek and start-up of Echo Springs).Other:For 2010, the segment's operating profit was $191 million, against $66 million in the prior year. This year-over-year improvement can be attributed to higher production margins from NGL and olefins.ReserveAs of December 31, 2010, Williams' total proved natural gas and oil reserves were approximately 4.5 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), including international reserves of approximately 0.2 Tcfe. Natural gas accounted for about 94% of the total proved reserves.Loading...Loading...Capital Expenditure & Balance SheetIn 2010, Williams incurred almost $2.7 billion in expenses for its domestic exploration and production business, of which $988 million were targeted toward development drilling and $1.7 billion for growth acquisitions.As of December 31, 2010, the partnership had debt of $9.11 billion, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 55.6%.
