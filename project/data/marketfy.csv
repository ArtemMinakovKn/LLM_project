The recent strength in energy stocks has helped SPX; on the other hand, the weakenss in biotechs have held back Nasdaq.

It will be interesting to hear from SLB on Thursday to see how the recent low oil prices have affected the industry.  KSU on Friday will allow us to get a peak from the rails.  GE and HON can give us addition information on how the US economy is doing as a whole.On the up-side, SPX's nearest resistance is at 2040.  On the down-side, SPX has support at 2000 to 1990; and, then 1975.Sector WatchFAS(financials)FAS slid on Friday, but, the whole week was still positive.  We have JPM reporting on Tuesday afternoon, followed by BAC, WFC, BLK, and PNC on Wednesday morning.  GX, C, and GS will report on Thursday morning.  Most banks look neutral going into earnings.BTK(biotech)The biotech has been among the weakest sectors.  If it turns higher, it will certainly help fuel the recent bounce in the broader market.  BIIB was weak on Friday, as it announced the departure of its VP of Global Commercial Operations.  AMGN seems to be gathering some buyers.  REGN and VRX also bounced on Friday.SOXX(semiconductor)SOXX also slid on Friday.  ASML is reporting on Tuesday morning; INTC follows in the afternoon.  XLNX also reports on Wednesday afternoon.  Although the sector has been doing well.  The darlings in AAPL's ecosystem have not, namely CRUS, SWKS, NXPI, BRCM and AVGO.  So, it will be interesting to see how this sub-group do in the coming week.FDN(internet)FDN crept higher along with the broader market last week.  NFLX is report on Wednesday after market.  NFLXjust announced an increase of $1 of its standard membership plan from $8.99 to $9.99, which could be an indicator of confidence and comfort with is subscriber addition in the past quarter.

It will be a busy week next week, not only because of Greece, but, Fed watch and China's GDP should be in focus on Wednesday.  In addition, earnings season will kick into gear.  For the new week, we will have to see how much progress will the bailout talks make overnight to get a sense of how investors will react to begin the week.

Internet heavyweights will keep the sector in focus.  Semiconductors have been really weak, so, we'll keep an eye on those.Sector WatchFAS(financial)FAS managed to close above its 10-day MA.

MNST may be setting up for a breakout is the broader market continues to bounce.FDN(internet)FDN closed right at its 30-day MA.  NFLX's earnings on Wednesday should be interesting once again; but, its options may be too expensive to play.  EBAY and GOOG are more palpable, as the options are more reasonable.  We will take a closer look during the week.SOXX(semiconductor)SOXX has been really weak, falling for 3 weeks straight!  BRCM, SWKS, AVGO have all fallen back.  Let's see if these can bounce up from last week's lows.Energy stocks may continue to be weak, as Iran is close to reaching a nuclear deal, which could lift its embargo and in turn place more oil supply on the market.

9807,Central Bankers The Movie - December 23 2014,http://marketfy.com/product/cup-handle-macro-research/blog/1167/view/67769/,2014-12-23,BLK,marketfy,"Click Here for this Week's Full Letter - December 23, 2014Greetings,Over the next five years, film studios are scheduled to release 26 “comic-book” movies. At some point studios will run out of characters, and when they do, I think they should launch a new team of superheroes called “The Central Bankers.” Sent from planet Academia, The Central Bankers are here to protect financial markets from the ferocious Bears. The opening scene could be Janet Yellen’s press conference from last Wednesday.All jokes aside, it’s remarkable how addicted asset prices have become to monetary stimulus. According to Bank of America,83% of world equity market capitalization is supported by 0% interest rate policy. The US stock market had its best two-day rally since 2011 after the FOMC press conference, finishing +4.5% higher. In my opinion, it wasn’t so much that stocks rallied, rather the market simply cooled-off leading up to the press conference fearing Yellen would put a timetable on rate hikes. Once the Fed confirmed it was willing to be “patient,” stocks resumed their record-setting rally.The S&P 500 continues to look bullet-proof, but other regions are struggling mightily:In Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, 5-year inflation breakevens have fallen below zero – pricing in outright deflation. Greece, Europe’s problem-child, failed to elect a President in their first round of voting last week. Early electionswith the potential to destabilize the Eurozonewill be called in January.It’s the same story in Asia. December Manufacturing PMI in China fell below 50 for the first time since June – signaling a contraction. Australia, which was also hit by a lone-wolf terrorist attack last week, saw 3rdquarter GDP grow a measly 2.7% Y/Y, compared to economist expectations of 3.1%.And then there’s Russia. While the developed world is desperately trying to combat deflation, Russia’s currency crisis will likely push CPI into double-digits early next year, despite a 6.5% rate hike last week.Food inflation is already a major problem, and there are fears of a nationwide food shortage. More on Russia below…My Marketfy portfolio rallied ~3% last week. Very disappointing results, in my opinion. I had the Mon-Tues selloff followed by a Wed-Thurs rally called perfectly, but poor position sizing negated most of the gains. Frustrating, but it’s hard to cry about profits. We’ll get ‘em next time. Now that most December catalysts have passed, I expect the market to quiet down into year end.  My December Investment Letter went out yesterday and it’s a very high-conviction bet –if you’d like to start receiving these letters click here. It’s $8.25/month, which would buy you more than 2 bushels of corn. Except that corn won’t improve your portfolio’s returns.Today’s letter will cover several topics, including:Houston, You Have a ProblemSaudi’s Get SlammedRussian Commie’sChart of the WeekWith that, I give you this week's letter:December 23, 2014As always, if you have any questions or comments or just want to vent, please send me an email atmike@cup-handle.com.Until next time, tread lightly out there,Michael LingenheldManaging Editor – Cup & Handle Macro"

If I had the available cash I would have been a net buyer as I stated in my updates earlier this week.Mainstream media (CNBC, Bloomberg) even Twitter and Social Media at points can seriously affect our drive and focus as investors. Does a 1000 point overreaction or even worthy drop on the DOW change the thesis of our several MicroCap investments, not a chance.MicroCaps with little institutional ownership are not affected by Wall St, since the latter cant sell what they don't own. Granted, some do swing if retail or holders do sell, but this offers generous opportunities for MicroCap investors.I made it a point not to sell or trade on Monday - since I want my members to focus more on my research and make their own decisions.I have not watched mainstream media in 3 years, and there is value in not watching it.1)Everything on Mainstream media is old news to the MicroCap investor who is researching2)Usually its an over or under reaction, and holds little value3)Usually emotional and not quantitative4)Detracts from research and can lead you to sell positions whose thesis' has not changed.5)Leads to group think instead of self-thinkHold your convictions and stick to your plan. Always remember that a change in price is not a change in the story, but the former can offer a serious buying opportunity.On days like Monday, either buy or hit the beach in my opinion. Both are safer bets most of the time than sweating at your desk.Focus on finding the best MicroCaps before anyone else does and energize your MicroCap investing strategy by taking advantage of days like Monday where the world goes crazy. Micro and Nano-cap investing is very far from mainstream investing due to size and coverage, so take advantage of being far from Wall St (for now)This is just a short-and-sweet post to reflect on this week. Members, please post your comments on ourlatest reporton AcuityAds, and ourrecorded CEO interview here.I am interested on whether you liked this shorter blog post, or our research reports better (example, SMTP).Non-members can enter our 14-day FREE membership lotteryhereBack to researching,Tom"

This could have quite an upside potential, perhaps to $70.LCILCI jumped +6.42% today.  It has also turned the corner.  This could easily test $46.BIIBBIIB has been in trouble since August.  It could be turning the corner now.  If it does, it has a LOT of upside!The health insurance stocks are all drawing bottoms.  They were all up today.ANTMCIHUMNear-term targets:  HUM $180-$185; CI $145-$155; ANTM $140-$150.Good night andHappyTrading! ™"

Then, we locked in gains on AET calls (+63.9%), as UNH made a buyout offer. I talked quite a bit about MBLY and we scored as high as +53% on MBLY calls on Wednesday.

As negotiations failed on Sunday between Greece and its creditors, US stocks sold off early on Monday.  Although things bounced off of the morning lows, the broader market still ended in the red.However, two groups stood out.  One is cybersecurity.  Buyers continued to buy up names such as CYBR, PANW, and FEYE.  CYBR hit a new all-time high today at $71.86 and ended up +6.59%.  FEYE added +2.55%.  PANW also made a new high today at $177.4.Healthcares popped higher in the afternoon, as more rumors about potential M&A deals circulated.  CI shares vaulted +12% on rumors that ANTM  may be looking to buy it.  This evening,there was a report that ANTM has made a $45 billion offer for CI.  The was also a report that claims that UNH has approached AET with an offer.  ANTM ended the day up +2.33%.  UNH added +1.13%.  AET gained +4.44%.  Ironically, the loser of the day in this group was HUM, which jumped a week ago from around $180 to over $220 on takeover speculation.  HUM shares were down 2.77% today.It looks like things are heating up in healthcare.  I think both CI and AET will go higher tomorrow.  The interesting thing is that CI may want to buy HUM to ward off ANTM.  This makes HUM interesting again!Good night andHappyTrading! ™"

24158,Looking for Long-Term Value Look South SO,http://marketfy.com/product/dr-stoxx-options-letter/blog/1187/view/72851/,2015-02-17,D,marketfy,"The following article is sponsored by theDr. Stoxx Options Letter.It's hard to believe, I know, but the strongest sector among U.S. stocks last year was the utilities sector.  Normally thought of a safe haven for long-term conservative investors, utility stocks were suddenly the go-to place for a very different kind of financial animal: the ""momentum stock"" trader...at least for a while.We've seen a substantial correction in the utilities sector so far this year, however, with many of the key players trading off 10% or more from their year-to-date highs.  To blame, primarily, is the strong rebound in treasury bond interest rates, which itself has been caused by the end of the Fed's quantitative easing program (among other things).  As rates climb, those looking for income and safety tend to pull money out of stocks and plow into safe havens like bonds and treasuries.  This is why a chart of the 10-year yield with the utility stock index overlaid shows a clear tendency of the two asset classes to mirror each other:[source:MarketWatch]I'm in the camp that counts this pullback in utilities as a great buying opportunity.  Nothing has changed in the fundamentals of the underlying companies; and the lower share price makes their dividends all the more attractive.  Right now you'll pay less for more yield than any time since October last year.  Among domestic utilities, there are 5 big players: NextEra Energy ($46B), Dominion Resources ($42B), Southern Company ($42B), American Electric ($28B), and PG&E ($26B).  All 5 companies are trading at least -10% below their 52-week highs.   And all 5 companies have seen their dividend rates climb at least 50 basis points, making them attractive places to park cash for those looking for discounted income.My favorite among the big 5 isSouthern Company (NYSE:SO). This utility company generates electricity through coal, nuclear, oil, gas, and hydro and distributes it in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida and Mississippi. Since peaking at $53.16 in late January as investors sought the relative safety of utilities, the stock has fallen about 14% in less than three weeks' time, the largest pullback of the top 5.  That is a move statistical importance: it hasn't been matched since the tail-end of the Great Recession, a time with a very different economic context.  Shares are therefore ripe for a bounce from here.As of February 17th, the dividend yield of SO is 4.58%, the largest yield of the top 5, and about 110 basis points above the large-cap utilities index average.  At the last earnings announcement on February 4th, the company came in a bit light on eps, missing its 4th quarter estimates.  This was largely due to charges related to delays in the building of a $8 billion nuclear plant in Georgia, along with a drop in residential sales.  The good news, however, is that industrial sales were up 3.3% quarter on quarter, much higher than industry average.  This bodes well going forward as industry in the region served by Southern is an a strong upswing.As the chart below shows, SO is in a deeply oversold condition.  Shares have already completed a 61.8% Fibonacci retrenchment of its August to January run.  They are also touching its 200-day moving average which coincides with an area of former price support.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI - 14) is printing a rare oversold reading below 30.All the above combine to make Southern Company a compelling buy for long-term investors, especially those looking for income. I consider shares to be attractive at this level, and I expect a rebound toward the 50-day moving average (currently: $49) over the next few weeks.If you buy the shares, you can collect the 4.6% dividend after 12 months.  But in theDr. Stoxx Options Letter, we have a way of collecting even more than that in half the time.  Our put-write strategy allows us to collect a 5.5% dividend in 6 months, which annualizes to a 11% yield.  This is a low-risk way of adding income to our trading capital, and if we are put the shares, we can always sell calls against the shares to lower our cost basis even further."

35803,The Pain of Falling Prices - January 6 2015,http://marketfy.com/product/cup-handle-macro-research/blog/1167/view/68672/,2015-01-07,EW,marketfy,"Click Here for this Week's Full Letter - January 6, 2015Greetings,Happy New Year! Market activity in December was actually more volatile than I anticipated, but ultimately didn’t have much impact on my portfolio. After launching in early August, the “Cup & Handle Fund” finished the year up 14%, a slightly disappointing yet acceptable result considering stocks only gained 5%. I feel very comfortable with my positions as we enter the New Year, and there’s still a sizeable amount of cash waiting to be deployed when attractive opportunities arise. The bull market in uncertainty continues to run full steam ahead, and I’m ready for the parabolic move higher - it’s just a matter of “when.”Market pundits are still touting the US as thefittest of all industrialized economies, yet there are still extreme deflationary pressures. Last Friday, the ISM Prices Paid Index recorded its lowest reading since 2012, and the second lowest since the Great Recession. For all the talk of lower oil prices helping consumers, I don’t see how they will support the economy. Thehighly respected hedge fund Bridgewater Associates believesoil will actually slow GDP by 0.5% in 2015, and theWall Street Journalseems to agree withmy theorythat Texas is headed for recession.It’s redundant to say this every week, but Europe is still a mess (more on this below). Last Friday, ECB President Draghi gave his strongest hint yet that he’s about to launch a large-scale QE program involving sovereign bonds. On the same day,a senior member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s partywarned the ECB not to buy debt from Greece or other struggling EU countries – i.e. the countries that need it the most.Meanwhile,there’s speculationthat Japan could be the first country to test Bernanke’s “Helicopter Money” theory – although Milton Freidman originally came up with the idea in 1969. There wouldn’t be a physical helicopter involved in the execution, but rather pre-loaded debit cards passed out to all citizens. After 12 months, the remaining balance on the debit cards would disappear, incentivizing consumers to hit shopping malls early and often. I’m highly skeptical this will happen in 2015 – after all the BoJ had 4 dissenters over the last expansion of QE – but that’s the direction monetary policy is headed. Interest rates can’t go any lower and QE offers diminishing returns, but cash handouts would almost certainly boost spending while changing our perception of free markets.January is always a good time to focus on the two R’s: reading and reflection. It typically takes a few weeks for institutional portfolio’s to rebalance giving investors much needed time to outline important themes in the year ahead. That’s what I’ll be focusing on in this newsletter over the next few weeks while formulating my January Investment Letter –if you’d like to start receiving these letters click here. It’s $8.25/month, which would buy you more than 2 million BTU’s of natural gas. Natural gas will keep you warm, but won’t boost your portfolio.Today’s letter will cover several topics, including:Setting Up for a Greek TragedyThe Sand TrapWinners and Losers – 2014 EditionChart of the WeekWith that, I give you this week's letter:January 6, 2015As always, if you have any questions or comments or just want to vent, please send me an email atmike@cup-handle.com.Until next time, tread lightly out there,Michael LingenheldManaging Editor – Cup & Handle Macro"
37891,The Blank Crisis - January 20 2016,http://marketfy.com/product/cup-handle-macro-research/blog/1167/view/102058/,2016-01-20,FCX,marketfy,"Click Here for this Week's LetterGreetings,In December 2014 we noted that the gold/crude oil ratio had never broken above 20 without the development of a “nameable” crisis. Both assets are synonymous with inflation. Gold is more of a monetary barometer, while oil typically reflects the level of economic activity. In that regard, the spike in gold/oil makes sense, because central banks are pumping stimulus into the system but it’s not resulting in stronger growth. It’s far too early, but if a crisis does unfold, what would it be called? Undoubtedly the name would include “China,” but the Chinese don’t deserve all the blame for this.Remember, it was the Chinese who rescued the global economy from a depression in 2009. The violent swings in Chinese stocks get all the attention these days, but that’s not why the S&P 500 is slumping. On Tuesday, the IMF downgraded its projection for growth (again) over the next two years. They now estimate the world economy will grow 3.4% this year and 3.6% in 2017, down -0.2% from their estimates last fall. China’s +6.9% Y/Y GDP reading for 4Q15 might be bogus, but the country’s growth is still much higher than anywhere in the West. The problem is that policymakers globally became way too dependent on China for growth, and now their economy is shifting gears.China accounts for 34% of global growth, and the nation’s multiplier effect on emerging markets takes that number to over 50%. Take oil for example. Coal still accounts for 70% of total Chinese energy consumption, but the country plays a huge role in the oil market. In the decade ending in 2014, growth in Chinese consumption accounted for 48% of the totalgrowthin global oil demand. This was never going to be sustainable. Now, oil supply is outpacing demand and prices are falling. This gives a huge boost to USD, which tightens liquidity in China because of the currency peg. Now, the PBoC is letting CNY decline a little bit as a release valve and everyone is panicked.However, it’s a mistake to think the recent CNY depreciation against USD is part of the “currency war.” In a sluggish global economy, it would take a considerably larger depreciation to boost exports enough to offset downward pressures elsewhere in China. And a big devaluation would contradict Beijing’s core strategy of moving from exports toward domestic consumption. CNY is down -6% vs. USD since July, but it’s still up +25% since 2005. Other central banks, like the ECB or BoJ, might respond to a weaker CNY by pushing down their own currencies, but China’s just protecting their interests by offsetting the Fed, not racing to the bottom.This Chinese slowdown is nothing new, only the narrative has shifted. Last year, it looked like China would just pass the baton to the US as the ballast for global growth. Now, weak 4Q data indicates the US is just as vulnerable as everybody else. To make things worse, the Fed, seemingly oblivious to what’s happening in the market, formally raised interest rates in December after watching monetary conditions tighten relentlessly since August 2014. That’s why markets look so shaky, not Chinese stocks. Unless the Fed reverses course, it looks like the global economy is off its moorings and headed into uncharted waters.With that I give you this week's letter:January 20, 2016TheCup & Handle Fundis up around +1.5% YTD, and +6.0% Y/Y. Not the start we were looking for, but outperforming all of the benchmark indices. I think everyone came into 2016 with little exposure, then started selling heavily when everything turned down. At some point I think those positions will get cleaned out and we’ll see a decent rally before another downdraft. We’re positioned to do well in either scenario, it’s just a matter of being patient.If you’d like to start receiving these letters click here.As always, if you have any questions or comments or just want to vent, please send me an email atmike@cup-handle.com.Until next time, tread lightly out there,Michael LingenheldManaging Editor – Cup & Handle Macro"

Still China is aiming for a 7% GDP growth for 2015, although it seems that economists outside of China does not believe in that number.Whether online or on TV, everyday you hear people arguing over Fed's up-coming decision on interest rates. Then, they worry about China's economy and whether or not China's GDP numbers are real. Finally, they try to rationalize what happens on the stock market each day, coming up with a ""reason"" for which ever way the market goes. I think these are just ""noises"", either people trying to make themselves useful by coming up with mental explanations for what is happening to feed the media, or people trying to ""mislead"" others by creating a false picture to make the scene even more confusing.If you have not realized this, you should at least try to consider it: the stock market is a game! There are many facets to the game, and, we play the ones that we can. Most of the big trades on the markets are now being done by computer algorithms. Only the price actions will tell the truth. There does not necessarily always need to be logical reasons, especially when the markets are range-bound. Certainly, the computers do not understand ""reasons"". All they know is what are mathematically ""possible"", and, they often act along those possibilities, or rather ""plausibilities"". Soon enough, actually on Wednesday, we will know whether the Fed raises rates or not. There is really no need to stress ourselves out over the Fed, or trying to read all the arguments over whether the Fed should or should not raise rates. It is not the game that we need to play. At least, it is not for me.So, having said all that, let's see where the US markets stood after Friday's close:SPXOn Friday, SPX added +8.76 points to close at 1961.05. It closed above its 10-day MA. The MACD went up.NasdaqNasdaq gained +26.09 points to close at 4822.34. It closed above its 20-day MA.

Here's today's performance chart on the for the portfolio:Come see whatEcstatic Playsoffers and what we are trading next!Inmy article last night, I pointed out that that we could ""quickly"" see SPX at 1900.  Today, we punched below that, before bouncing higher.  At today's close, SPX finished below 1900, at 1893.21.  However, the market did close on a weak note.  In October 2014, SPX fell all the way down to 1820.  It is quite likely that we will see 1820 to tested again!Also, if you have not, please take a look at my article, titled ""It's Time to Migrate Out of Oil!""  As I questioned in the article, are we going to see $30/barrel on oil (WTI) soon?  It has already fallen to $38/barrel today.  Oil has been over-drilled, over-stockpiled, and the usage is going to decrease faster and faster as renewable energy sources take over.  Oil is likely going to play a much smaller part in our future energy use.  While the markets tumbled, solar stocks found buyers today.  Already, solar stocks are ""decoupling"" from oil stocks.  In the past year, traders have been trading solar stocks along with oil stocks.  But, that behavior will soon change.  If oil continues to drop, solar stocks should hold or rise.  If oil bounces, you can bet that solar stocks will rise as well.  It's time to migrate out of oil before it becomes like coal, both in our everyday living and in the stock market!Good night andHappyTrading! ™"

It does not seem like it will find a support any time soon.  The US Oil ETF, USO, is almost single-digit.  I think it will soon need a reverse split, or else, it might lose another 30% soon.  Could this mean that, before long, oil will reach $30/barrel?!Energy paradigms are shifting around the world.  Coal is already on its way out.  Take a look at the coal stocks such as BTU, CNX, and JOY.  How about some names that are barely trading, such as WLT, RNO, and ANR.  In 2011, BTU was a $70 stock.  Where is it trading now?  Less than $1.5!!While I do not think oil will fall as fast, as it will take longer for renewable energies to completely replace oil, it has already been over-drilled and the usage is about to decline faster and faster.  We all know that electric and hybrid cars are becoming more and more popular.  TSLA stock has skyrocketed.  Will we soon see hybrid/solar planes for commercial flights?China is making big changes in its energy policy.It has pledged to increase its total energy budget on renewable, zero-emission energy sources to 20%!Thelinked articlestates:""China has been alsoinvesting heavily in solar power. In 2013, it installed a record12 gigawatts of solar power. In 2014 the country addedanother 12 gigawattsof solar power, reports Bloomberg News, narrowly missing itsgoal of 14 gigawatts.""In one year, the biggest oil companies such as XOM and CVX have lost tremendous value.  XOM is down about 30% and CVX has lost more than 40%!  Smaller companies are doing worse.  NOV, for example, has lost more than 50% of its market cap in just one year.  Even Buffet appears to bedumping oil plays, shedding the likes of PSX and NOV.Offshore drilling stocks such as DO and RIG will likely be worthless within the next five years.  RIG is already approaching single-digit.If these energy companies were to survive, they will probably have to invest in renewable energy sources soon.  This is not just about what energy sources are more economical; it is really more about the survival of our planet, and of ""us"".  Governments around the world are already making stricter policies on carbon emissions, and they will likely get tougher in the years to come.  When it comes down to our own survivor, you can bet that global governments will find ways to help make renewable energies economic enough to replace oil, if technology doesn't get us there itself.Good night andHappyTrading! ™"

But, both are still within the trading range, even though Nasdaq has made a new all-time high.  It is still unclear whether there will be a follow-through to that breakout attempt.  For the new week, Greek issues are still on deck.  If a deal is made and Greece is able to avoid a default while staying with EU, markets will rally.  If not, markets may falter again.SPX needs to break above 2130 for a breakout, which may be a tall order.  On the downside, 2090 is an immediate support; then, solid support exits between 2080-2070.  Nasdaq, on the other hand, can push higher above 5120, if the breakout gets any follow-through.  It has support down to 5070.Financials are still looking health.  But, energies fell weak again!  Software still seems strong even though ORCL missed its earnings estimates.Sector WatchFAS(financials)FAS was heading for a breakout on Thursday, but, the drop on Friday brought it right back to its trading range.

APC, EOG, and APA all fell back.  OXY is holding up surprisingly well.IGV(software)IGV was heading for a breakout, until Friday.  But, surprisingly, even with ORCL's earnings miss, the group is holding up!  Its MACD has turned higher (bullish).  This could be partially because online security software is being chased.  CYBR, FEYE, and FTNT have all acted strongly.  What happens when the chasing is over.  If the broader market turns weak, we are going to see some quick exits out of these!TLT(bonds)TLT made some interesting moves last week.  The MACD is now bullish.  This could be setting up for a breakout.  Now that we know, rates are going higher, but, perhaps not as much as (and/or as early) as people had thought.  TLT could see a pop.  We'll keep an eye on this next week.I think it's going to be one of those ""news-driven"" weeks.  First of all, any news out of Greece is going to be closely watched.  Any concrete new development could drive the markets.  M&A news are still coming out in many sectors.  So, let's keep our eyes open and ears tuned in!

But, stocks may slip as the buying momentum wanes. Before the sharp drop, people were looking for a pullback. The pullback was so sharp that it brought most sectors into the correction territory in just a few days! Thus, the sharp bounce is warranted. Now, that the bounce has taken out the downside overshoot, we may see stocks slip again.""Indeed, the buying faded.  Besides the bounce on Wednesday, there was not much buying.  Tuesday brought a quick drop, sending the market down to test 1900.

Asian markets were mostly lower on Monday, as the US markets were closed in observance of Labor Day.  Tonight, at the time of this writing, Asian markets were mixed.

For the new week, the major indices will start out in vulnerable positions.  But, the selling has slowed.  It's perhaps more difficult to find reasons to buy right now.  People are already worrying about China.  Now, people might even ponder on the effects of Syrian refugees migrating into Europe.On Wednesday afternoon, we will get earnings from PANW.  What's perhaps more influential is the Apple event on Wednesday.  Besidessome other major companies, LULU also reports on Thursday.

The selling has slowed in this sector as well.  BIIB has been looking to bounce as analysts have called it oversold.  AMGN, GILD, and CELG look weak, but, perhaps oversold.  CLVS and HRTX are on the stronger side.SOXX(semiconductors)SOXX also managed to close above its 10-day MA.  This sector has been selling since July.  It is trying very hard to draw a base right now.

76721,Are You Ready For A Pullback BIIB AMGN GILD CELG UTHR JAZZ GOOG FB NFLX APA APC EOG PANW DO RIG,http://marketfy.com/product/ecstatic-plays/blog/891/view/89542/,2015-08-07,PANW,marketfy,"Stocks reversed the morning gains today and ended lower.  TheDowwas down 120.72 points (-0.69%);Nasdaqfell 83.5 points (-1.62%);SPXdropped 16.28 points (-0.78%).In this week'sMarket Forecast, we discussed the possibility of leading sectors (biotech, internet, software, financial) finally falling back and pulling the broader market down.I have been saying for a while now that the broader market will not pull back, unless biotechs pull back.  Today, biotechs suffered a steep loss, contributing much to Nasdaq's 1.62% fall.  BIIB was among the weakest, losing $18.81, or 5.61%.  Here are some other biotech names and their losses today:  JAZZ -3.99%; ESPR -7.75%; AMGN -3.84%; GILD -2.83%; CELG -3.52%; UTHR -4.14%; CLVS -3.89%.Internet stocks started out the day quite strong.  AMZN was up $5 in the morning, but, ended down $7.55.  FB was up more than $2 and ended down $1.32.  PCLN, GOOG/GOOGL, and NFLX held up pretty well.Software group was also weak.  IGV just made a new all-time high yesterday, but, gave it all back today.  CRM -2.9%; RHT -3.12%; MSFT -2.02%; ADBE -1.43%.Financials were only down slightly.While these leaders pulled back today, energy stocks made a bounce.  DO and RIG led the way, up +6.54% and +12.16%, respectively.  SLB added +1.32%; APC gained +2.89%; EOG climbed +2.09%; APA popped +4.86%.  It does seem like the energy stocks can bounce higher from here.Tomorrow, we will get the latest unemployment rate and nonfarm payrolls.  It will be interesting to see how the market reacts.  But, from today's selling, I sense that there are some big sellers out there.  Biotechs were liquidated across the board.  Other techs were sold off as well.  PANW, for example, was down more than 8%, which was easily the biggest down day for PANW in years!  Buyers are more and more reluctant to drive stocks higher.  Instead, big sellers loom after a few strong days.One chart in particular has been flagging warning signs to me for a couple of weeks now.  Let's take a look at the Dow's weekly chart:This is a 2-year, weekly chart for the Dow.  You can see that there's a rounding top and falling MAs.  We have not seen this type of ""topping"" development in at least a couple of years.  Both Russell 2000 (RUT) and SPX are showing the potential of the same formation.  RUT is basically there already.So, while the bounce in energy stocks and the dip-buyers may prop up this market for a little longer, I think the selling pressure is building up.  I do not think, however, this is all about the Fed's intention to raise rates starting in September.  I think this is more that things are just getting too overbought, technically, to be keep heading higher.  We will need to see a pullback before drawing more buyers back into the market.Some people are saying that a lot of traders are still on vacation, and, when they return, stocks will rally again.  I think otherwise.  I think ""if"" the market does not pullback soon, when the traders are back from their vacation, they will drive the markets down.  There is no point in buying an overbought market that is teetering on a cliff, so to speak.So, are you ready for a pullback?Good night andHappyTrading! ™"

Well, as mentioned above, Greece has imposed capital control and ordered banks to close for a week, although ATMs will remain open with a 60 euro daily limit on withdrawals.  For the new week, the markets look to open on the downside.  SPX's initial support is at 2080.  Below 2080, there is support between 2060-2040.  It's difficult to say how far the market will fall.  A lot will depend on how well EU can contain the situation.  Let's take a look at some major sectors:Sector WatchFAS(financial)FAS closed above its 20- and 30-day MAs, although its MACD went lower.  Big banks are holding up well.  GS, JPM, WFC, BAC were all neutral on Friday.  Same thing goes for the credit cards such as MA and V.FDN(internet)FDN managed to close above its daily MAs.  But, if things pull back with the broader market, we could quickly see this sector turn bearish.  FB has just had an amazing run.  It could have a lot of room to pullback to (so, does TRIP).  AMZN also still looks healthy.  GOOG is neutral.  PCLN is a bit weak.BTK(biotech)This sector has been among the strongest.  But, if things pull back altogether, investors will likely take profits in biotechs.  Some of the recent high-flyers include:  BIIB, INCY, LLY, KITE, HRTX, CLVS, and BLUE.IGV(software)IGV closed just below its daily MAs.  On Friday, cybersecurity stocks (which have been hot lately) pulled back.  CYBR, FEYE, VDSI, PANW all pulled back quite a bit.  These may get hit again on Monday morning, but, we should see some buyers come back in.  Cloud space has also been hot.  But, it may be the next target in a weak market environment.

As negotiations failed on Sunday between Greece and its creditors, US stocks sold off early on Monday.  Although things bounced off of the morning lows, the broader market still ended in the red.However, two groups stood out.  One is cybersecurity.  Buyers continued to buy up names such as CYBR, PANW, and FEYE.  CYBR hit a new all-time high today at $71.86 and ended up +6.59%.  FEYE added +2.55%.  PANW also made a new high today at $177.4.Healthcares popped higher in the afternoon, as more rumors about potential M&A deals circulated.  CI shares vaulted +12% on rumors that ANTM  may be looking to buy it.  This evening,there was a report that ANTM has made a $45 billion offer for CI.  The was also a report that claims that UNH has approached AET with an offer.  ANTM ended the day up +2.33%.  UNH added +1.13%.  AET gained +4.44%.  Ironically, the loser of the day in this group was HUM, which jumped a week ago from around $180 to over $220 on takeover speculation.  HUM shares were down 2.77% today.It looks like things are heating up in healthcare.  I think both CI and AET will go higher tomorrow.  The interesting thing is that CI may want to buy HUM to ward off ANTM.  This makes HUM interesting again!Good night andHappyTrading! ™"

83503,Oil Going Lower,http://marketfy.com/product/ecstatic-plays/blog/891/view/101379/,2016-01-11,SLB,marketfy,"In August 2015, I wrote an article, titled ""It's Time to Migrate Out of Oil"".  Oil is now approaching the $30 mark and USO is single-digit!  Solar stocks have recent jumped.  This trend will likely continue.As I said in the previous article, ""Governments around the world are already making stricter policies on carbon emissions, and they will likely get tougher in the years to come.""  In December 2015,global leaders finally agreed on a climate change deal to cut down emissions world-wide.  Things are quickly changing.  Oil stocks are tumbling.  Names such as SLB, EOG, NOV, and PSX are hitting new multi-year lows.  Offshore drilling are very weak, which I had discussed back in August.  RIG is just above $10 now.  I think it is very likely that offshore drilling will be banned in the next few years, or at least, it will more costly comparing to new ways of harnessing renewable energies.As you can see in the chart below, the energy sector's weighting in the SP500 has been decreasing in the past 3 years:On the other hand, technology has been increasing.  Solar stocks, interestingly, are not energy stocks, but, technology stocks.The ""de""-coupling of the solar stocks from the oil stocks have finally happened, and in quite a big way.  We can see in the chart below that in December 2015, TAN (solar stocks) made a big jump as USO (oil) continued to fall:This dichotomy may continue to become more pronounced.The markets have been weak since the start of the year.  With obscured views of the global economy, investors decided to lock in profits from 2015.  Solar stocks, along with the broader market, have also pulled back.I think oil stocks will continued to be weak.  But, it may not be quite just the time to jump back into solar stocks either.  The markets have been very volatile.  We may have to wait until mid-February to make long-term investments.Good night andHappyTrading! ™"

87153,Beyond The Biotech Space - Stryker Corporation NYSE SYK,http://marketfy.com/product/5-star-biotech-portfolio/blog/1156/view/76357/,2015-03-17,SYK,marketfy,"SYK forms a rectangleAfter rallying nicely from mid-October until the end of December, SYK has been trading sideways over the last 3 months.After rallying nicely from mid-October until the end of December, SYK has been trading sideways over the last 3 months. During the sideways move the stock has formed a common pattern known as a rectangle. A minimum of (2) successful tests of the support and (2) successful tests of the resistance will give you the pattern.SYK’s rectangle pattern has formed a resistance at $96 (blue) and a $90 support (green).  At some point the stock will have to break one of the two levels.The Tale of the Tape:SYK is trading within a rectangle pattern. The possible long positions on the stock would be either on a pullback to $90 or on a breakout above $96. The ideal short opportunity would be on a break below $90.Before making any trading decision, decide which side of the trade you believe gives you the highest probability of success. Do you prefer the short side of the market, long side, or do you want to be in the market at all? If you haven’t thought about it, review the overall indices themselves. For example, take a look at the S&P 500. Is it trending higher or lower? Has it recently broken through a key resistance or support level? Making these decisions ahead of time will help you decide which side of the trade you believe gives you the best opportunities.No matter what your strategy or when you decide to enter, always remember to use protective stops and you’ll be around for the next trade.  Capital preservation is always key!Good luck!The Biotech Trader"

89203,Top Setups for Feb 25,http://marketfy.com/product/tactical-alpha/blog/1237/view/73560/,2015-03-17,TJX,marketfy,"Given the weakness in biotech and AAPL today, I expected the market would finally have some kind of a pullback, however minor.But  it wasn't meant to be: other sectors like financials stepped up and led  the market higher. The S&P finished the day some 0.3% up and the  grind goes on.Here are some of the setups I will be watching tomorrow:AIZ  - At a first glance this is an ugly, bearish chart, but seems to have  solid support at 60 and could be getting ready for an oversold bounce  toward 63-65EVC - Controlled pullback to support around the 20dma, will be looking for a bounce through 7HDB - Venky's favorite stock, continues to slowly move higher out of  the short consolidation base, expecting acceleration with more volume  toward 62MATR - High and tight flag suggests it may be getting ready to push through 7.40-7.50SZYM - Well developed bottoming pattern, now needs to get through 2.70TJX (SHORT) - Bearish reversal on high volume today and a somewhat toppy pattern on daily, likely downside to 62-64"

96293,Do We Buy Semis For A Trade,http://marketfy.com/product/sp-sectors/blog/1179/view/88538/,2015-07-28,TXN,marketfy,"From a more structural perspective Semiconductors have been a space we’ve wanted to stay away from for most of the year. Every time the sector index made new highs, it quickly failed. This along with consistent bearish momentum divergences on multiple time frames over the past year have kept us in the cautious camp and we’ve preferred to look elsewhere for long positions.Looking at the PHLX Semiconductor Index, prices today are exactly where they were a year ago. This is essentially a basket of chip makers including the likes of Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Intel, Broadcom, etc. The first chart shows the weekly candlesticks coming down to former resistance from last year (shaded in gray) that also served as support earlier this year. Notice how we are also right at this uptrend line from where this rally first got going in the second half of 2012.With momentum putting in lower highs over the past year while prices rallied and then failed after each new high, we’ve been gun-shy on the long side. Looking at it today, RSI has held near the 40 level without getting oversold. That’s a good thing. If prices can hold onto this support and can prove it can stay above this uptrend line, I think that structurally this would be very positive.Here is a closer look at the Semiconductor Index. Notice the bullish momentum divergence as RSI put in a higher low while prices made new lows over the past week:The way I see it, there is a ton of potential here if prices can hang on to these levels. We only want to be long semi’s if prices are above this uptrend line. If prices cannot get/stay above it, then I do not see any reason to be involved on the long side. The levels are very well defined, which is what we want.We can have potentially 75 points to the upside in this Index, but again, we would only want to be long if we can get above and stay above this uptrend line. If that doesn’t occur, then this is a moot point. Either way, the level is clear and I believe it’s well worth watching.***Click Hereto receive weekly updates of these charts on multiple timeframes including 30 other Sectors and Subsectors across the U.S. Stock Market."
