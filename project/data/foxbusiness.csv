1921,Qualcomm and Broadcom would dominate wireless business,http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2017/11/06/qualcomm-and-broadcom-would-dominate-wireless-business.html?cmpid=prn_benz,2017-11-06,AVGO,foxbusiness,"VideoThere are plenty of potential benefits for both Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) should the two tech giants merge, including cost synergies and a conclusion of Qualcomm’s legal disputes with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, Qualcomm will likely reject Broadcom’s bid as “too low,” and opt to remain an independent company. When it comes to the companies’ sector competitors, they are probably hoping this deal completely falls apart.On Monday, Broadcom officially launched a takeover offer for Qualcomm for $70 per share, which values the company at about $103 billion. According to Reuters, this would be the biggest technology acquisition ever.As a unit, the two companies would benefit from cost synergies, according to Canaccord Genuity, while the bank’s analysts also expect Qualcomm will reject this initial offer.“We believe the combination could create shareholder value through potential accretion, synergies, increased share with Apple and Samsung; in addition, Broadcom could potentially settle the licensing dispute with Apple in a more-timely manner than could Qualcomm, given Broadcom’s strong relationship with Apple,” Canaccord Genuity analysts wrote in a note to clients.They added that a combination of the two companies would create a dominant wireless business and overall powerful global semiconductor leader.While Qualcomm and Broadcom stand to benefit, it would increase competition for other semiconductor companies, notes Canaccord Genuity. Companies that could be negatively impacted include Intel (NASDAQ:INTL), NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NXPI), Qorvo (NASDAQ:OORVO), Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) and CEVA (NASDAQ:CEVA).More from FOX BusinessWall Street climbs to record highs amid merger talkTax reform implementation is path to 5% US economic growth: Tony SayeghDudley cuts New York Fed leadership term short, forcing search for perfect chiefBroadcom's $70-per-share offer is at a premium to Qualcomm's closing price of $54.84 on Thursday, a day before media reports of a potential deal pushed up the company's shares. The stock soared Friday, closing at $61.81 after The Wall Street Journal reported that Broadcom was considering a bid.Broadcom’s shares are up about 53% year-to-date. Qualcomm’s shares are down over 3%, even after posting large advances on the speculation, and eventual reality of the takeover offer. Qualcomm’s share value has taken a hit from the legal battle with Apple. In its notes on the merger, Canaccord Genuity analysts believe Qualcomm’s shares have traded well below fair value."

Neidorff, Centene CEO, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Centene has demonstrated disciplined execution, agility and capacity to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders.""In 2018 Centene will enter three new state markets: Kansas, Missouri and Nevada. It will also expand service in six of its existing markets: Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Texas and Washington.The company has been expanding its footprint under the Affordable Care Act steadily over recent years and says it served 1.2 million members on the ObamaCare marketplace as of March, doubling its consumer base from December 2016.Centene, however, is bucking a widespread trend in the insurance marketplace, where companies have fled over policy uncertainty and rising costs. Already this year, Aetna (NYSE:AET) and Humana (NYSE:HUM) announced they would not be offering coverage for customers on the marketplace in 2018, citing instability and the damaging costs of exchange participation.More on this...Anthem to exit ObamaCare marketplace in OhioAnthem weighing ObamaCare exit as uncertainty growsBlue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City pulls out of ObamaCareA big source of tension for insurers is whether the government will continue to fund cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies, or subsidies paid to health insurers for discounted care provided to low income individuals. Republicans have alleged the subsidies are unconstitutional and the matter has been taken up in the courts. However, the Trump administration delayed a ruling on CSRs last month and has committed to continuing to fund the subsidies until a decision is reached.In the meantime, the GOP is attempting to advance its effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which passed the House of Representatives last month and will be sent next to the Senate for amendments and another round of voting."

32011,Will Madden NFL 18 score for Electronic Arts?,http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/08/24/will-madden-nfl-18-score-for-electronic-arts.html?cmpid=prn_benz,2017-08-24,EA,foxbusiness,"A slight downtick in expert review scores for this year’s edition of the “Madden NFL” video game could impede sales for Electronic Arts’ (NASDAQ:EA) flagship franchise, but not enough to spook investors, according to one analyst.“Madden NFL 18” garnered an average “Metacritic” rating of 80.5, with reviewers touting the addition of cinematic “Longshot” story made and improved graphics. However, that rating, while solid, is down slightly from the 83.5 mark that last year’s game achieved, as well as the “Madden” franchise’s 10-year average of 82, PiperJaffray research analyst Michael Olson wrote in an Aug. 22 note to investors.“While some investors may be expecting a year-over-year uptick in Madden sales, we remain comfortable with our estimate for 5.5 million units (flat year-over-year). … Overall, we think the lower metacritic scores for Madden this year are not a material negative, but suggest the title is unlikely to be a source of revenue outperformance,” Olson wrote.More on this...NFL, Electronic Arts launch ‘Madden 18’ video game tournamentColin Kaepernick supporters to protest outside NFL headquartersKaepernick supporters to protest outside NFL headquarters in New YorkESPN under fire for pulling announcer from UVA gameThis year’s game is the 29th installment of the “Madden” franchise and features New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady as its cover athlete. The “Longshot” story mode – the first of its kind for Madden – features voice-acting from Academy Award-winning actor Mahershala Ali.Aside from the new game mode, Electronic Arts recently announced the launch of “Madden NFL Club Championship,” an online eSports tournament involving all 32 NFL teams. Olson argues Madden sales totals could exceed expectations given the buzz around the “Longshot” and a potential “marketing halo” from the competitive gaming initiative.Strong console sales could also drive digital revenue from Madden “Ultimate Team,” a game mode that allows players to buy card packs and items to customize their teams, Olson added.Electronic Arts gave a lukewarm sales forecast for its current fiscal quarter last July, projecting revenue of $1.16 billion, below analyst expectations. Both Madden and the popular “FIFA” soccer franchise are set to release their latest versions this quarter.However, the video game company is enjoying a strong 2017, with shares rising nearly 50% since January."

(NYSE:KR) tells FOX Business that it’s trying to close one of its California-based Ralphs grocery stores so Kim Kardashian West can go shopping for an hour in peace.And it won't cost the reality star a penny—except for the groceries.A spokesperson for Kroger says they heard about the star’s birthday wish on The Ellen Show Wednesday when she told host Ellen DeGeneres that all she wants is to buy groceries without getting mobbed.“What I really asked for my birthday, you guys — this sounds so crazy and it might be really bratty, and unrelatable, so I'm sorry — but I asked for, I said, ‘Can someone just rent out Ralphs for me for one hour?’” Kardashian West said.Kroger says it's working on contacting Kardashian West's team to offer the private shopping session for free.More on this...How this style startup got Kim Kardashian West as an advisorThe now 37-year-old says she loves going grocery shopping but hasn’t had the opportunity to go in “years” because of her celebrity status.“I just want to go to Ralphs with my kid in the cart and go through every aisle,” she added.The last time the “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” star was seen at a grocery store was in 2015 at Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMAZN) Whole Foods with her then six-year-old nephew, Mason.It's been too long,@KimKardashian!

In 2016, Kroger’s said this unit of its business generated $1.4 billion.""Our convenience stores are strong, successful and growing with the potential to grow even more,"" said Mike Schlotman, Kroger's executive vice president and CFO, in a press release. ""We want to look at all options to ensure this part of the business is meeting its full potential. Considering the current premium multiples for convenience stores, we feel it is our obligation as a management team to undertake this review.""Kroger said it has begun exploring “strategic alternatives” for its convenience store unit because it has determined these assets “are potentially of more value outside of the company than as part of Kroger.” The company has hired Goldman Sachs to help guide it through the decision-making process.The announcement comes amid increased competition in the grocery aisle from Whole Foods (NYSE:WFM), which was taken over by tech giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) this year, and Wal-mart (NYSE:WMT), which is expanding pick-up options for its grocery division.Shares of Kroger rose as much as 6% on the news, but were up about 3% as of mid-morning on Wednesday."

Baker Hughes merged with GE’s (NYSE:GE) oil and gas business last summer, putting the company under the GE umbrella.In a statement, Schlumberger noted that investment in North American oil and gas seems to be decreasing.“In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, activity continued to weaken in the third quarter, and the outlook remains bleak for this region based on current customer plans,” the company wrote.More from FOX BusinessTop oilfield services firms signal fourth-quarter uncertaintyThree major takeaways from GE’s earningsUS STOCKS-Tech, bank stocks lift Wall St; tax-cut plan back in focusThe energy sector declined 9.4% year-to-date through this Wednesday’s close, making it the second worst performing sector in the S&P 500 index. But, according to the Center for Financial Research and Analysis (CFRA), things have started improve, with the sector advancing 9.9% after bottoming on Aug. 18. The two-month increase was largely a reaction to higher oil prices.The CFRA said it is now “less cautious” on the energy sector, and said they expect third quarter earnings season to be “good” for the energy sector. Earnings reports from energy companies will continue next week, with Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) scheduled to release its latest results Monday."

However, he added that his company doesn’t plan to sell any of the products in the U.S. until marijuana is legal nationwide, even if other states like California – which is expected to legalize the cultivation and selling of recreational marijuana in 2018 – get passed. Instead, he says the company will focus on selling its new products in overseas markets where recreational marijuana is legal. “Canopy Growth has a seasoned leadership team that understands the legal, regulatory and economic landscape for an emerging market that is predicted to become a significant consumer category in the future,” Sands said in a statement. “Our company’s success is the result of our focus on identifying early stage consumer trends, and this is another step in that direction.”"
